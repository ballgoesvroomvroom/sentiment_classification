Good food but inconsistent,neutral
"Love the pizza, pasta, and baked sea bass. Great place with great atmosphere!",pos
I went there for Christmas day. It was 6 courses with reasonable price. They gave a stuffed toy for children. Good for family gathering and orchard road view.,pos
Food here is really good. Wish they‚Äôd do more for special occasions. Not for romantic dates.,neutral
"Nice
Ambiance friendly waitress - keep up thr good job !!!!üëè",pos
The sauce is spoiled and has sour taste,neg
I like to go to the Italian restaurant for latte and cakes üç∞ üëçüòä,pos
Pasta was too overpriced. Pizzas were decent.,pos
It is a noisy and party like environment. The food and service are great as usual.  Try the grilled sea bass. You will not regret it.,pos
Best Prime ribs!,pos
Fine dinning experience at an affordable price. The food quality and presentation is great and I am greatly satisfied with the quantity. Prompt customer service available always. It is one of my favourite place to dine in.,pos
Not followed order request so cup 1/3 empty and not extra hot!,neg
"I have had my dinner here last week. I really enjoyed the meal and absolutely satisfied with the food and service. Lawry‚Äôs prime rib has served the very good quality steak, the salad made in front of me, but the lobster tail was a bit ‚Ä¶",pos
It's our second visit and the food is awesome! Definitely gonna frequent this place for the yummy food!,pos
Lobe the ambience and the staff was super friendly and helpful.,pos
Excellent service by Joms.,pos
"Love the food. Weekly eat out place. Onion ring,  salad, food n chips and western wilder. The different flavour od ice tea is nice, too",pos
Well recommended,pos
"enjoyed my experience!! came here for a birthday celeb, the 90minute picanhas free flow with wine is great if you have a big appetite. The medium rare is slightly too chewy, would go for the medium instead. would come back again~",pos
The food is cold and also very expensive.If not because of the discountI won‚Äôt order from Collin with that kind of price,neutral
"Lunch: Nice truffle rosemary crusted lamb‚Ä¶have it medium or medium rare‚Ä¶so succulent

Dinner: Fine dining price, family restaurant ambience.

Be mentally prepared for noise if you are there as a couple. Be glad you have this option if you are there as parents with your young children.

Not right or wrong. Just have the right expectations.",neg
"We had a table by the full length window which gave lots of natural lights. My daughter was happy as all the food photos turned out very well. Food, especially lava cake was great. As we ordered too much pizza, didn't have room for mains. Will try it next round.",pos
"Either truffle or Parma ham scacchiatas, are so palatable. The cream wasn't overwhelming at all, as well as the cheese. Certainly you can order a Small serving and more than enough üòù",pos
A wonderful surprise when the staff presented a birthday cake for my wife and daughter. A real treat for them.,pos
"The steaks are too oily, the soup is starchy and the sour cream arediluted.",neutral
Delicious üòã,pos
"Used our AMEX Love Dining for a well priced meal at this traditional-style chophouse. Definitely get the Lawry‚Äôs cut and ask for extra gravy. The Yorkshire pudding goes great with it too. The ribeye is pretty good too, and comes with roasted vegetables. Spinning salad is fun to watch but nothing too impressive on taste. Overall great experience for a special occasion.",pos
Too cramped and hot.,neg
The attendants were not very friendly. Deserves better service for the food price.,neutral
"Pizza and seafood stew are really nice we love it. tiramisu so yummy üòã, we would like to visit again.",pos
"Excellent service, friendly staff, really good food.",pos
"Always awesome. What else to say. But order wisely, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt understand why people love this place. Must order‚Äîmeatballs and pasta pomodoro",pos
Simple no frills restaurant with great rosti to go with the great coffee they serve and nice truffle fries too,pos
Great place for great food. Service was great as well. Staffs were always friendly & helpful. Will be back again.,pos
"Celebrated husband‚Äôs birthday at the restaurant and we had a great time. Giri and his team made us feel very welcomed, and very attentive in their service. Kudos to the team and we will be back again very soon!",pos
Good was a disappointment. The sirloin steak was rather rubbery and not a nice cut. Spag Bog was ok though source was a little sour.,neg
Hot food is so so but chocolate stuff are great. Understaffed resulting in slow service at all areas occasionally.,pos
"Very slow for a Friday night. Food dragged a bit, but was done very well. 
Only complaint is the prices. I know it‚Äôs Singapore. I know Hard Rock has a name and a cult following. But it really was a bit overpriced.",pos
"First time eating at Lawry's with my friend. We chose the Summer 4-course set meal. The prime rib medium rare is tender. However the mashed potatoes were not fully mashed, with a big piece of potato unmashed, which I did not expect at this atas place.",pos
Excellent place to dine with our furry friends.,pos
Creme br√ªl√©es durian was not available the time I went for the visits. Definitely return for the next occasion,pos
My perennial favourite for good food and service.,pos
"We have a birthday celebration at this wonderful restaurant, over nice food and friendly staff üëçüëçüëç",pos
Nice and fresh ingredients. Authentic Italian food. Love the grilled seafood and vegetables.,pos
Fantastic food and service as always. One of the best in Singapore.,pos
Food was great though would prefer well cooked risotto. Only had alfresco sitting for our lunch - so the sun was in the way amidst a nice ambience,neutral
Nice American style restaurant.,pos
my go to for Italian food. however the biggest problem is that their dining time is limited to 2h,pos
Restaurant was busy and noisy but the food was really good and service is fast!,pos
Kids were disappointed coz the main playground is now a private club so they can‚Äôt play there. Lots of non-accessible up areas .  Food was standard pasta fries .,neg
"Great food especially the braised beef! The pasta nice too but portion bit small. The pizza base texture is to my wife‚Äôs liking. The table that we sat is quite warm, not sure the place was too packed or air-conditioner was not strong enough.",pos
"Service is impeccable and the staff were all warm and welcoming. Food was good, however the prices are not exactly justified for how ordinary the food was.

Apart from the beef itself which was fantastic, the portions for the rest of the items were small and the sides were not exactly top-notch. Came here to celebrate Valentine's Day but wouldn't exactly return unless we have something to celebrate.",neutral
Great and friendly service from the staff,pos
Fantastic staff. Super friendly. The atmosphere is so instagrammable especially if you like toys or brick bear etc... Food especially the baked rice is so delicious. The latte is awesome. Definitely 5 stars!,pos
Fantastic food and services. Will definitely come again.,pos
Halloumi salad was pretty good.,neutral
The pork belly was slightly dry. The pasta is good as usual. The atmosphere was great despite a little hustle and noise. Overall not bad.,pos
Excellent service. We were made to feel welcome the minute we entered the restaurant. The roast beef was excellent as usual and the desserts were great. Try the crepe suzette for something different. Price is not cheap so be prepared for the bill at the end!,pos
"Great food and service. Thanks for the cake for my early birthday this month.
Special thanks to Manager Mr Musa, Jazz, Sue and Nine for your superb service. Thank you for everything.",pos
Staffs could be more friendly and smile especially during this festive period. Don‚Äôt ruin others mood with their grumpy face.,pos
More sauce would be better.,neutral
Very nice latte and pizzas available at this wonderful Italian restaurant üëçüëçüëçüòäüòäüòã,pos
Best Italian Osteria ever! Better than those I visited in Italy.,pos
"As usual, great wholesome and tasty food, efficient and convivial service!! My place to go when I want no-nonsense comfort food in Singapore! See you guys soon!!",pos
A homely place for me. Had a warm seafood guazzeto with garlic bread. Filled and fueled me up.,pos
Awesome food! Loved all the sides and handmade pasta! Great place for celebrations and even dates!,pos
My second time here within 3 months. As a usual the beef was great although should have had it medium vs medium done... and they always have specials. This round was Singapore national day .. 4 courses plus champagne at 199 for 2!! Great ‚Ä¶,pos
"Great taste, portion size, price, and service! Will put this on my recommended restaurant list.",pos
"Great ambience. Colonial style set up is quite cozy and romantic. Staffs are quite friendly and helpful. Good tasty food. We enjoyed beef steak especially. Overall, we enjoyed our date at Wildseed Cafe. will definitely visit again.",pos
"Been a few years since I last ate at PS Cafe. The Jewel outlet's food was decent in general. Would definitely recommend the truffles fries though! Atmosphere is great. However service was not the best for me and my friends who sat near the water vortex at the back of the restaurant. Twice while we were chatting, worms fell from the ceiling/the plant to our plate (thankfully we had finished by then) and the staffs were not apologetic when we told them about this and did not proactively offered to change the seats for us. There were no form of compensation for the bad experience as well. If I were to go back to Jewel outlet again, will definitely explicitly request for an indoor seat instead.",neg
"Food is a bit too pricy and portion not very big. Visited a few times only for the live band. I have tried steak, pork collar, beehoon and carbonara. None of which I found to be outstanding but relatively acceptable at best. The bee hoon  in collagen broth was the first thing I ever tried.

 It was drabby in appearance and bland. I asked for soy sauce but there was none to be provided. I was given salt to adjust taste to my liking. 

Hope food can improve...",neg
"our family comes here often, quality of food has dropped since last year (children's roast beef are sinewy, salad's beetroot are getting smaller) but overall still acceptable, good friendly service, ambience is good too.",neutral
"Good food, nice selections of wines and great service. Definitely will comeback!",pos
"I think there is a event on 18/12 so the restuarant is quite busy and I feel we are not so well attended to as well as the dishes are not as nice as the 1st time I went. Still, the ambience is wonderful",pos
Very nice ambience and excellent food quality! Service staff was very friendly and prompt.,pos
An enjoyable dinning with my guests here!,pos
Great service and decent food. Went there for a course meal and the highlight was definitely the beef. It'd be better if the staff could be more attentive at times. Overall a good experience!,pos
The staff are very friendly and attentive to the customers' needs,pos
"Great ambiance and great food. Staff, especially Shailah, extends superb service given the Christmas holiday rush. Thank you.",pos
Ernest is always at hand to please! Friendly yet professional.,pos
Food is good but would prefer Rostti with sausages. Price is on the high side.,neutral
The burgers seems to be getting smaller‚Ä¶ both the bun and the meatpatties.,neutral
"Food was good and the waiter that serve us food is great too. The downside is another personnel asked us to settle the bill when we are in the midst of celebrating our friend birthday (taking photos), i believe there could be better timing for bill settlement. Also, appreciate if we are given ample warning of ‚Äúwe are 10 minutes to closing‚Äù instead of just walk to our table and say ‚Äúwe are already closing since 3pm‚Äù (it was 3.10pm then). This doesn‚Äôt seem welcoming. Do you expect customer to remember your closing time?",neg
"Had the roast prime rib lunch SG cut with their 30% off steaks on wednesday. Came up to $73 net. Don't think the food justifies the price. Feel that I'm paying more for the brand name, location, view, ambience and pomp.",neutral
Beside the fact that the sticky chewy chocolate was not as chewy &‚Äòsticky‚Äô. It tasted more like durian than chocolate.,pos
"Great sea bass and bruschetta . Place was rather crowded and noisy though. Servers were trying their best, but think place was too crowded perhaps,",pos
really really good Italian food and their hot chocolate is amazing,pos
Very tasty food,pos
"Good service.
Good food but pricey",pos
Tastes good but victim of shrinkflation. The 1/4 rib is about half the sizeof what it was a few months back.,pos
"Great service from the staff and the steaks were great. Celebrating  my buddy‚Äôs belated birthday, and I left a comment requesting for complimentary cake or dessert, to which the restaurant very kindly catered for. One of my favourite steak restaurants around, been there 5 times so far!!",pos
Some of the tables are placed under the blast of the air-conditioning units.,pos
ÁâπÂà´Â•Ω,pos
"BBQ station, only yakitori is good. Noodles station i only tried the Laksa but I felt I had many better ones. I wouldn't serve those oysters that are puny and pathetic. Desert station, bread pudding lacks flavour. Service was exceptional though.",neutral

"It‚Äôs hard to doubt a steakhouse that has been open for over 20 years, and Lawry‚Äôs has shown that serving good quality steak with exceptional service is key to its 20-year success. The ambiance of this steakhouse is second to none, stepping in you are greeted with high ceilings reminiscent of the dining halls in palaces overseas. From the moment you step in, to the moment you leave, the staff there are friendly, always greeting you with a smile.

When at Lawry‚Äôs, one has to try the steak that is their namesake, their prime rib. I chose to side mine with some creamed spinach, something that is reminiscent of American steakhouses, which is hard to find in steakhouses in Singapore, much less one that tastes this good. Of course, those are just the accouterments, the main star of the show is the steak. Which tasted phenomenal, succulent and perfectly medium rare, making a perfect pairing with the sauce. I highly recommend coming here, although the name suggests steak, Lawry‚Äôs has managed to keep up with the times, offering other meats like chicken and pork, which are also cooked to perfection. I recommend getting a cut off the prime rib when you do come here, as there is a spectacle to be seen. A chef will wheel out the wagon, who will then proceed to cut one off the roast, which if it is your first time, it will seem magical.

From the ambiance to the food to the service, Lawry‚Äôs Singapore definitely holds up to its name of being one of the oldest steakhouses in America, but also Singapore.",pos
Staff hardly smile.,neg
The sandwiches were lacking sauces and I had ordered toastedsandwiches but they didn‚Äôt toast. Also special request was not to putice in Sprite but the cup was full of ice.,neg
"The restaurant was relatively easy to get to from the MRT.  The food was tasty and prepared well.  We waited quite awhile for our bill only to be told, politely, to just go up to the cashier.  Pretty noisy inside.  On the whole we would go back.",pos
"Definitely nice cafe to hang out . 

Definitely will go again to try those cakes and dessert .",pos
"Good food as always, and service was attentive even thought the restaurant was crowded. I‚Äôve been patronizing IO for several years now and have noticed that their prices have been creeping up over time unfortunately.",pos
"Overall a good experience. Food was good, service was good, atmosphere was fine (furniture a little tired). Only comment is it‚Äôs stupidly expensive even for Singapore. Every American chain or restaurant has a bit of a ‚ÄúSingapore Tax‚Äù but it just seemed Lawrys was a little over the top. Totally understand it‚Äôs right on Orchard (prime real estate) but for what it is, it‚Äôs not great value all things considered.
If money is no object, would definitely recommend for a nice Sunday evening dinner.",pos
Delivered v fast & still hot & chicken not overly cooked/dry,pos
It was a very disappointing high tea. Service was not forth coming. Waited half an hour for tea/coffee to be served. Another 15 mins for the high tea to be served. Seat was not comfortable as the seat was low & high arm rest  Too much sweet items vs savoury.  Totally not value for money having to pay $68/pax. Earlier made a reservation for the brunch on Natl Day but cancel it after today's experience & the food taste.,neg
"The environment and service attitude are very good
But compared with the United States and Taiwan
Tastes worse than America ‚Ä¶",neutral
"Had birthday dinner here. The prime rib portions are quite generous, service was great and we had a really good time!",pos
Fast service but maybe a different chef this time round,pos
Very nice steak.,pos
"friendly prompt service crew. there hit and misses for the dishes we ordered. for Caesar salad, go for grilled chicken will be a safer bet. we order the trout...which isn't so fresh. pulled pork quesadilla was quite tasty. Shrimp pasta is fairly done. The hot wings are good.",neutral
"Lamb quality is bad. My son‚Äôs lamb portion is all fats and hardly anymeat. The packaging is bad; lamb, mash potatoes and salads all throwninto a box; look horrible and lamb sticking onto mash potat",neg
"Steak just place on trolley and sliced in front of client , prefer the steak to be cooked on the trolley . The steak taste good but suggest to take the cow skin away before serving .",neutral
Portion was a bit small but food was not bad. Delivery was fast andsmooth!,pos
My favourite healthier options! Gluten free is good!,pos
"Good as always.  Instad of the truffle bread, we went for the roasted, which was very good.

The lasagna and the orichette were also very delicious.  It wqs an early dinner for us, so we practically had the restaurant to ourselves.",pos
"This place has very authentic italian food.
But it would be better if the chef's specials can be written down for clearer understanding as some terms may be hard to catch.",pos
Missing order!! Order six piece tender came with 4 pieces!,neg
"Food was great, a good selection of wines and can cakes! Service staff was attentive even though it was packed. Spent about $80 per person.",pos
It was soggy - NOT crispy.,neg
"Excellent service and food!

Staff were very friendly and accommodating. ‚Ä¶",pos
lousy...hard ...,neg
"The place is untidy, floor is dirty and toilet is dirty.  looks short handed.  waiter and waitress put on smiles.  but it is very difficult to get their attention.",neg
"Everything was great!
The whole family enjoyed the food and the service was quick!",pos
"Been here twice.
We will definitely be back soon.
Thank you",pos
"Not my first time here, decided to celebrate my friend's birthday there. Must not be my luckiest day, as I failed to find the cheese in the chicken cordon bleu, but the chef and staff were great in service recovery. Thanks for turning my day around! 10/10 service!",neutral
Food was absolutely divine! Service was fast as well but clearing of plates were a little slow and kind of had to help ourselves. The ambience was pretty nice and chill for a night out for an affordable price. Would recommend getting the roman stuffed stracchieta and check with the staff of the pasta specials for the day as well!!,pos
If can choose sauce for pork ribs will be good.,pos
"At Lawry's you know exactly what you are gonna get. You'll step back into this old world atmosphere. You'll get a spinning bowl salad prepared tableside on a bed of ice, served on a cold plate, and you'll eat it with a cold fork with Lawry's seasoned salt. You'll get prime ribs carved tableside on a silver trolley by a guy in a tall chef's hat wearing a gold medal üèÖ around his neck. You'll probably get the California/English cut (if you have a smaller appetite) or the Lawry's cut (if you have a bigger appetite). You'll also get a side of creamed spinach or sauteed mushrooms, and then a Yorkshire pudding will be served in a pan. You will probably be too stuffed for dessert. What you get here is consistency. Over the years it has always been the same. Are the uniforms a bit lame? Yeah I think so, especially the gold medal bit. But I think it's good value with the Citibank promotion if you just stick to what you came for, delicious prime ribs. If you liked this review please hit like so that more people will see it.",pos
Great value for money. Taste was good and fast delivery,pos
"Loved the food, ambience and service. Fresh, authentic Italian food.",pos
food tastes lousy.. lamb was very tough.. practically inedible‚Ä¶ verydisappointed,neg

"We enjoyed the food especially their pizzas, stuffed schiacciata and pitaschio tiramisu.",pos
Very small portions except for the brownie which is huge. Nice experience overall,neutral
Spicy chicken burger lives up to its name :),pos
Irwin was great!,pos
Good location & prompt service,neutral
Food is great as usual. It can get abit hot but that‚Äôs fine because there are giant fans.,pos
"Enjoyed the food, enjoyed the service! Good recommendations from service staff, both for wine and food. Pleasant, homely ambience. A place to chill out with friends and family!",pos
"I would say the experience in Lawry‚Äôs is the best-ever service I have in Singapore. No matter before, during or after the wedding private function, they are keeping their standard very thoughtful, helpful, friendly and even more than I expected. The staff are very considerate and the signature dishes quality are excellent. It is value-for-money to book their restaurant as private function and enjoying the high ceiling with the natural daylight came into the room, which made the event photos came out nicely. Thank you the team who help us out with the background music and the room decoration. We are more than happy to come back again.",pos
Easy to make a reservation but they didn't seems to find our reservation easily. Went for Sunday Brunch. Food and services were excellent. Will recommend.,pos

Have a wonderful birthday celebration and would like to thank and give a shout out to Yoga and Rama for making this a wonderful experience. Thank you!!!!,pos
A nice cozy environment. Good place to eat steak. Best steak!,pos

"The food is good, ambience is great and service is superb! We feel special with Toni‚Äôs attention.",pos
Fast delivery and food arrived hot. üëç,pos

Best steak ever. Fresh ingredients,pos

Food was good, the mushroom soup, Cajun chicken and seafood pasta do try!",pos
Excellent food and service!,pos
Fantastic prime ribs. Great service and setting. Fair prices too.,pos
"Food was still warm enough when they arrived, tasty and good portion.Will probably oder again.",pos
"Great variety of quality dishes, friendly service staff, kids friendly",pos
it was very expensive mashed potato.,neutral
"The wait staff are young and new but I could see the effort. But being in a world class hotel, they should have a senior to accompany them. Otherwise food is good.",neutral
"We had an enjoyable dining experience at Lawry‚Äôs for my partner‚Äôs birthday. The cosy ambience, friendly staff and nice food enriched our experience. Prices are on the high side, but we managed to save a bit due to credit card promo :) in summary, we had a good time. Thanks Lawry!",pos
"Wonderful food and service, as usual. I usually just go with the server‚Äôs  recommendations as it‚Äôs always spot on.",pos
"All food are good except laksa fish & chips bcos the laksa cream, the coconut taste is over and not spicy. Overall are good. Definitely will be back again.",pos
"Good ambient and server. 
Food is fine excellent . ..",pos
Visit was 10/10. Came for our anniversary and they served us perfectly great.,pos
"This place serves good steak. However, the service does not meet expectations. Considering the exorbitant prices, the service level is comparable to that of a slightly better fast food chain.",neutral
Very American style. Loved it,pos
Went there 2x in one week. Great atmosphere. Good cooking with substantial portions. Service needs more practice and refinement.,neutral
Food tasted great. The restaurant was a bit smokey and came out smelling like food.,pos
Guacamole was not freshly made - it was partially brown,neg

Prefers other menus which I have enjoyed more in the past. 
The fish and chips was still good choice by my friend.",pos
Cool looking fine dining reataurant,pos
Italian osteria has really good food and great selection. I enjoyed the lasagne,pos
Food is good and will find time to visit again.,pos
Went on Christmas eve and it was very crowded and noisy. Food was so so too.,neg
Best Pizza because it is still good when cold and even next day,pos

"Great food, good vibes. I'm a repeat customer and would continue coming back :)",pos

"Thank you so much for the great dinner and service! Waitresses were so kind, will definitely come back again :)",pos
Honestly the superfood salad is a scam. The main I greffent is salad. There is no ‚Äúsuper food‚Äù in this salad and the price is outrageous for what you get. No proteins a part from few grains and couples of almonds. No vegetarian options apart from Omni dishes that can be ‚Äúvegetarianized‚Äù. It‚Äôs overprice and not even tasty,neg
Fast delivery and order is accurate. Food is still warm. Only thing is Iwould prefer the beef sauce to be separated from the fries so that thefries will not be so soggy.,pos
The salad served with the Reuben sandwich was bland,neg
"Great and homely Italian food. Love it here. The service was good too. The service staff to customer ratio is good, the food came quickly as well.",pos
Love it! Enjoy the food and service very much:) Thank U,pos
I love the food! Very legit Italian fare. Great for groups to hang out also.,pos
Awesome service and food as always,pos
"Visited Lawry's for a quite dinner and the restaurant lived up to the expectation and shout out to the staff for welcoming us, explaining menu and recommendation.. I will visit Lawry's again for sure",pos
The 1.5hrs limitation is a huge pain. Food is expensive and not spectacular. Not very inclined to return.,neg
"I have debating to wether to write this review or not. I usually do not like to give bad reviews but after discussing it with my wife i think it is best that other travelers are warned. Me and my wife visited Singapore for our anniversary. We choose Lawry's Prime Rib because of the reviews that it had and based on us be in the mood for steak. The appetizer's were good and worth the money.  We had the shrimp cocktail and scallops; we also had a Caesar salad which was good. The main course however was not good, it was kept warm in a cart that traveled around and you could add sides. The sides and the meat were not worth the money at all. This place is so over priced it is not even funny. I had prime rib and so did my wife. It was so bad compared with other restaurants of its caliber and price. We spent almost 400 dollars and got a sub par prime rib and sides. The steak and sides are so over priced. I believe you are paying more for the view than the food.  I unfortunately was looking for a great food experience for our anniversary but we did not get that. They did remember it was our anniversary and brought us a dessert for our anniversary. The staff did not speak clear enough english to understand them at all. I gave them one star which they deserve because the appetizer's and dessert rate a 1 star.",neg
"Please please can you actually slice the pizza  before sending it fordelivery. Every single time somebody does a half arsed job of cutting it,so that I end up tearing the pizza into clumps of dough.",neutral
Barramundi fillet was fresh enough. But the skin which was supposedto be crispy had become chewy. The prawn ‚Äòcakes‚Äô tasted mostly ofdough.,pos
"Always enjoy coming to this cafe - Great vibe, friendly staff and good service! Tong was especially helpful in accommodating our request for an outdoor table. Thank you !",pos
Was very very spicy,neutral
"I love this place (even though i don't eat beef!) for its old school vibe, great service and comfort food (love the creamed spinach and yorkie puds). Expect to hear the birthday song sung many many times",pos
"Would have been better if menu was updated more timely, or state seasonal menu if it changes often...",neg
Coleslaw only half filled. Only 1/3 cutlery provided. Not tasty,neg
The best Italian restaurant so far. Friendly staff add good portion of food. Here it is.,pos
Food and service great as usual. We were seated in the temporary back area as the building is undergoing renovations. Can‚Äôt wait to be back when the whole place is done.,pos
Lovely ambience; great food quality and friendly service! Lunch sets are good value.,pos
"A neighbourhood Italian restaurant that never fails to satisfy. Great ambience, casual dining, attentive service members and good selection of food on the menu, supplemented by interesting board specials. The seafood gnocchi was a hit.",pos
Good old school steak,pos
Really very happy to bring our little Nathaniel here as he is so welcomed by the staff,pos
"The chicken (in the risotto) was kinda dry. Feels like the standard wasn't as good as the Holland V branch, but it could just be a one-off.",neg
good,pos
"First time here! Had my birthday and it was a great experience. Everyone was welcoming and friendly, the service was top notch, attentive and receptive, we had our own little corner by the window as well. Food was excellent and so filling. Well worth the money. I believe I was served by Princess and Tuti? Special shout-out for being so kind! But all round everyone was great and I‚Äôd definitely go again for my fill of prime rib!",pos
The standard of food is still as good as before.,pos
The meat platter and pork belly burnt ends were fantastic and so was the cornbread.,pos
When I visit again please have stuffed chicken breast available!,pos
"Came here for my birthday celebration with my brother and was honestly quite appalled by the standard of food considering the prices. We got the dinner set meal. The prime rib and beef ribs were decent but they were definitely not worth the price.The lobster was rubbery and the amount of meat on it was just pathetic. The salad was overdressed and was really nothing special in terms of flavour. The desserts were the absolute worst, like an after thought. The cakes were dry and mealy. I left my dessert practically untouched.",neg
Like the atmosphere and decor. Food and service were good. Prime rib was tender and juicy. Lobster pasta was generous and tasty. Steak was decent but had better steaks elsewhere.,pos
"Great service and food. I love the ambience. Good place for chilling with your friends, partners.

We have the pork belly for starters. Ribeye and homemade tagliolini for main course. 
Reservation is recommended else you may not be able to get a seat.",pos
We are lucky to have Denese look after us at dinner. It was because of her attentiveness and humour on top of the good food that made it a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely be back.,pos
"Held a corporate luncheon at Lawry's private dining room and had a full turnout due to the central location & menu. Food was good, logistic planning was smooth and flexible and the overall experience was splendid. Thank you Ethel, Mona & Jess for the great help/service. Would 100% recommend.",pos
"extremely disappointed that Little Farm no longer serve the grilled rib eye steak. The frites was recommended as alternative, were cooked dried out and don't do any credit to the good meat that are sold at Little Farm.
It gives me the impression that the food is churned out from a central kitchen instead of by chef at the cafe now that the menu is standarised throughout the chain",neg
Great selection of Italian food... enjoyed the atmosphere during the Christmas festive period. Convenient location with ample parking makes this a good place for lunching out!,pos
Meat was raw as it was cooked on the wrong temperature,neg
"Had an exceptional dining experience here and it's one of the restaurants that guarantee a repeat visit. From the moment you walk in, the warm and inviting ambiance sets the stage for a memorable meal.
The star of the show is undoubtedly the Lawry's Cut Prime Rib. It's perfectly cooked, tender, and bursting with flavor making it a meat lover's dream. The USDA Rib Eye is another fantastic choice, cooked to perfection and full of robust flavour.

The spinning salad which is served table side added a fun, interactive touch to our dining experience.

For drinks, there's variety of options to pair perfectly with chosen meals. If celebrating a birthday, a complimentary cake is provided together with a photo making the occasion even more special.",pos
excellent. fast deliverym,pos
My Second time purchasing. The chicken are very crispy and taste well.,pos
"Chef JYI is amazing. My scallops and prawns were less salty. Special thanks to Dinesh who made me look sweet in my photo. Rin is very attentive and gentle. Rahman is vocal and well versed with other dining places, including introducing other outlets for me. He is an icon for Marmalade Pantry. Missed manager Mr Nigel who is on leave.",pos
Had a great dinner on a nice Friday evening. The porchetta and fennel stole the show with its melt-in-your-mouth texture. Shout out to the staff who enthusiastically checked-in on us halfway through our meal amidst all the crowd.,pos
All wonderful,pos
Food was disappointing and extremely salty.,neg
We had a great wedding dinner at Lawry‚Äôs. I come here a lot and always enjoy the juicy prime rib and the old-school atmosphere.,pos
I put in a request when I made the reservation to put candles in the dessert as I was celebrating bd of my 2 friends. Since we were arriving together and I wanted to surprise them I didn't manage to inform the server in person but I thought my remarks in the reservation were clear. The dessert arrived with no candles. What a disappointment!,neg
"Too many items missing from the menu. No duck, no roast chicken, no seafood (no mussels, no fish, nothing!), no French onion soup. It was a very disappointing meal. 

The only saving grace was the waitstaff who brought a complementary appetizer a d extended the happy hour special to make it up to us. 

Based solely on the food, I would not eat here again.  Nothing that I wanted was available and the food I got was meditated best.",neg
"Probably one of the not so good PS outlet. Mains were not served at the same time (Ann Siang, One Fullerton, Palais does) and service staff were not attentive",neg
The food taste good but the proce is on the high side.,neutral
"I gave a 2 rating for service cos there is not enough manpower. It was difficult to get hold of the staff. The chairs were uncomfortable as they are low. Also no place to place our bags & stuff we have. Hope the restaurant can look into it and change the table/chairs & able to provide a small stool to place our bags & stuff! Also staff gave wrong info abt the drink. Checked if the Rosemary drink was sour & was informed that its sweet but turned out to be SO SOUR & when we feedback to her, she asked if we want to add more honey? This was quite a disappointment!",neutral
Experience fine dining food with a calming atmosphere. Praise to the staff for the professionalism,pos

As she‚Äôs pregnant, the kind staffs whom served our table not only got a soft cushion to adhere to her sitting posture , but also making her dish cooked to doneness delicately.

We enjoyed the evening very much. & we were certain we will visit again in the near future! Kudos to all & keep up the good work!",pos
Food was great as usual But staffs was a lil inattentive,pos
Good stuff. The appetiser is superb. The tiramisu is a must try as well.,pos
"28 Dec 2019 - 2 persons at 5.15pm.

Mixed thoughts on both the food and service here.

Wouldn't travel all the way here again though as I live in the east.

Acceptable, even friendly service from some of the service staff and not so friendly, ""kind of attitude"" service from some service staff.

I was a bit put off by how grimy their drinking glasses were and there was food bits on one of the plates pre-set on our table. Their warm water tasted weird too.

We had the porchetta (S), baked eggplant parmigiana, burrata and traditional stuffed roman schiacciata truffles (S). The first two items were good - crispy pork crackling and flavourful, meat wasn't dry, eggplant was tasty with good texture. For the other two items - burrata wasn't creamy/milky enough, and the outer stretchy layer too thick, the truffle schiacciata needed more truffles. The small portions are good enough for two persons to share.

We didn't order any of their pizzas, pastas or mains as they didn't really entice us.

Prices very reasonable for the items we had.",neutral
Steep prices but nice ambience and food,pos
Good food and service - staff were very knowledgeable about menu and wine and their recommendations were spot on. Mains were quite rich - would have preferred something lighter after the starters.,pos
Always enjoyed the food here. Love the truffle cheese flat bread . Can‚Äôt get the name . The baked fish in salt is also delicious,pos
"Miss the buttered potato cubes that was no more on the menu, hope it will be back soon. This time around, tried the crispy Shimeji mushroom which was pleasantly nice too.. will come back soon as we are living nearby!",neutral
"Quite noisy, always full house. 90 mins dining only.",neutral
Lovely choice for a small birthday celebration. Big thanks to the attentive crew! I will return for sure to try other items on the menu.,pos
"I'm very familiar with the menu at Lawry's, and almost always goes for their signature prime rib roast beef. Never a disappointment.

As always, the meal was smooth and pleasant, due to the effortless service of the crew, headed by Mr.Musa. His presence gave us the assurance that our meal will be in good hands",pos
Great food but expensive. The location is quite quiet though.,pos
"Food is good, service is good. The ordering app did not work though so we had to order manually. The food took a little while longer than usual to arrive and is slightly pricy, but overall is ok.",neutral
Nice cosy ambience with brilliant service and attention from staff. Food was great and preparation time was just right. Definitely worth a regular visit.,pos
Superb service from manalem,pos
Affordable and delicious! Ordered raviolacci and beer braised beef wit mash potatoes,pos
Pleasant ambience and food there never disappoints. Definitely recommend this place.,pos
"Pizza was ok, chips were very soggy",pos
Excellent experience as usual. Staff was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed the dinner,pos
Sashimi was not the freshest but service recovery to offer a new plate without asking and attention to all our other needs made up for it. Oysters seems to have shrunk and a little dry compared to previous visits. Rotisserie section was attentive and generous when serving. Pasta section was great too specially with the ala minute cooking and long line. A little gutted the Xiao long Bao ran out. Overall an amazing experience with great food and impeccable service. Will definitely recommend especially for those coming for special occasions too,pos
iO is an Italian restaurant that I usually frequent that never disappoints. Great food cooked by Italians and good service! Had the Tuna on the special menu and it was really good. Recommend the pistachio tiramisu for dessert!,pos
Great. Will be back!,pos

marguerita with an artificial tomato sauce very bad...too expensive forwhat it is,neg

Overrated. Good if you can get that 50% AMEX discount.,neutral
"2nd visit to the restaurant today, awesome food and friendly staff as 1st time.",pos
Probably one of the most tender and juiciest cut of meat we've had off the bone.  The lobster was disappointing - stick to the beef. Spinach in cream had a strong smell/flavour to it. Service was very good.,pos
Great atmosphere and friendly staffs! Thanks!!,pos
"Great food, excellent service, great value for money",pos
"Today‚Äôs dining experience was just okay. It‚Äôs the weekend but PS Cafe Harding had very few staffs. That which resulted to us following up our dessert, sticky date pudding (favorite), three times (sadly). Always in love with the location though. Lucky that weather was good earlier.",neutral
Unfortunately I was not able to take pictures but the 5 course meal with the Prime Rib was delicious,pos
Lost its charm. Service was inattentive and distant. Food was very average. Not value for money... not even the lunch sets.,neg
"We have been asked to leave after 1,5 hours because of weekend business. After consuming for a huge sum I think it is not acceptable to be asked to leave because the next customers are coming. For us a reason not to come again and not to recommend the restaurant. Over.",neg
"Okay. Steak was not medium rare like I wanted. Creamed spinach was not great. Too overpriced for lackluster food. However service was great! Won‚Äôt return, better places to spend money for food.",neg
I guess more traditional but quite pricey. Good food but not good value for money.,neutral
"This spacious restaurant offers authentic Italian food, drinks and desserts üëçüëçüëç",pos
The meal started well with the spinning bowl salad and I love the croutons in it. Steak is expectedly good and it ended on a nice note with the mudpie.  Definitely a place to come for a nice treat.,pos

Nice. Hope it opens earlier for breakfast.,pos
Pocket friendly authentic Italian cuisine. Food were delightfully yummy and service was good!,pos
"For a meal that we had really been looking forward to, we left feeling only disappointment. The fish and chips were extremely fishy- we ate one piece for sustenance, tried the other two, and couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The chicken in the chicken rossa penne was hard and chewy at the same time.

Of note is the cauliflower gratin, which was delicious.",neg
Good spread of selection for every category of food in the menu. Servers are attentive and efficient.,pos
Good service and sufficiently spacious. The food was delicious too!,pos
"Good service. Good ambience. I ordered my steak medium well and the doneness was a bit more than I expected (was expecting a bit pink at the center).

I applaud them for having various seasoning and condiment (such as horseradish or whipped cream) for the steak. The special sauce in primero itself is good - unfortunately the sauce they offered for the rib eye/ tenderloin is somewhat lacking their special sauce",neutral
Clam chowder tasty but v little clams n v small. Prawns ok. Ice creamgd.,pos

Food so nice and a good price",pos

"Celebrated my birthday here and I can say, the foods we ordered were nice! Of course we tried their prime rib which is the star of the night! Will recommend!",pos
Taste of the food was a little too heavy for me. Serving size was rather generous.,pos
Been coming here for years and popped in for a drink during a quiet period. No one came by our table for 20 minutes and it was really hard to get any staff members attention despite it not being full. Another 15 minutes went by without them making any drinks so we had to get their attention again to remind them to make them. I hope it‚Äôs just a bad day but it was really disappointing because it‚Äôs usually great.,neg
Legendary restaurant,pos
We were reminded of the two hours meal time 15 minutes before it‚Äôs up though there weren‚Äôt many customers during our visit. It‚Äôs obvious there were few empty tables available. They should be more flexible on this.,neutral
Avoid the second sitting at the weekends. Serving staff are pressed and food arrives at 9ish. Last orders just after 10 and told it closed at 10:30. Other than being rushed the food and ambience were good.,neutral
Food & staff is great but they charge exorbitantly for mere water,pos
"The restaurant is not adequately staffed and they don‚Äôt appear well trained.

After reading good reviews of the restaurant‚Äôs efforts to acknowledge special occasions, we decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary there.  But it was a total disappointment as there was no effort by the restaurant to up its service.

The furniture is also very aged and poorer than a heartland restaurant.",neg
"Great meal and service as usual. We sat for 3 hours, never disturbed and with excellent service.",pos
"Great food, great ambiance, good service as always! will come again soon to visit and try out some other food! Just hope to have slightly more variety to choose from :D",pos
"Staff was friendly and food very good! One of the food took half an hour to serve, should pre-empt us when we were ordering and one of the pasta (raviolacci)  dish not served hot enough. Understand it was busy period so staff did the best they could. Otherwise the food and service was excellent!:)",pos
Love it!! Food is pricey but I don't mind coming again because everything tasted so goood,pos
I actually thought the steak quality is not as good as it used to be.,pos
For the price point the entire experience is really subpar. Steaks were underwhelming. Appetizers were okay. Nothing special and disappointing for a $100+/person meal,neutral
"If a customer is allergic to eggs, then the restaurant should have replaced it with ano ingredient to make the dish more flavourful & not so.. boring?",neg
"This was my third visit and it was a good experience, my guests certainly enjoyed it too. Excellent and professional service, good menu choices, interesting wine list. definitely worth another visit.",pos
Lovely place to dine at! The Sangrias were amazing!!,pos
"Great ambience, great food, great service",pos
"Food was great, we enjoyed it but then nearing the end of our time slot, the lady server who kept on asking ‚Äúany other order?‚Äù + missed to refill our water glasses and insisted she needed the table even though (1) it was only 4pm (2) there are plenty of empty tables (3) no Q of people waiting for seats, left a bitter aftertaste in the mouth.",neg
"Friendly staffs, foods are great and nice ambiance. Remember make reservations instead of walk-in.",pos
"Great tasting food at a casual setting. Been here on 4 different occasions and food has been consistently good. Pastas are well cooked (love places that are able to cook al dente pasta) and seafood platter is fresh and awesome! Breads are a must, doesn‚Äôt matter which one you order. Just order one and try. They‚Äôre crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 
Service crew came by to check on us a couple of times, ensuring everything was well taken care of. Definitely a tad bit pricey but it‚Äôs worth it!",pos
Food was awesome:) would definitely recommend the pork belly. Mouth wateringly good. Overall a very enjoyable meal with a fittingly tart end with the lemon meringue.,pos
"Great Italian food here, I especially loved the truffle bread :)",pos
"Overall food was nice but the service experience was less than perfect. The Italian pasta dishes tasted better than the meat or seafood dishes. Pizza was too thick. Need to be careful with their recommendations of food & beverage to customers, based on group size.",neutral
"The environment was great. It was not my first time dining at the restaurant thus love the usual truffle bread. The seafood platter was a bit disappointing as the fishes were overcooked. The pork belly was a little salty this time round compared to previous. They served blended soup which we love it so much! Overall, good experience and will definitely be back again to try more of their dishes.",pos

Great place to chill - all so nostalgic,pos
"This restaurant is always bustling with people, a clear sign of how consistently good the food is. However, be mindful if you are assigned a seat by the windows; while the natural light is pleasant, it can get quite warm. I was perspiring.

"We have been going to Lawry's in LA for over 40 years and wanted to visit one that was overseas to compare it with the original. We were not disappointed. The manager, Shafian (Yan) could not have been nicer or more pleasant. Our waitress, Yaya, was excellent and very personable and could work at any of the other Lawry's. The meal was of the standard that we have come to expect here in LA. My Makers Manhattan on the rocks was even the same. We really enjoyed the evening and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for great service and an outstanding dinner.",pos

"Had a very good Father's day lunch here earlier today.
This is an old-school favourite that I felt Dad would love and overall it was a good experience.
Highlights:
- the Roast Beef is as good as ever, having come here for years
- the Ribeye Steak was excellent
- the filet mignon was overcooked, but they kindly acknowledged it and allowed us to send it back, and the 2nd time was very much better
- they were kind enough to waive corkage on 2 bottles of wine
- service was excellent throughout our meal
Lowlights:
- the non-Beef items were mediocre at best...the fish soup that came with the set lunch was somewhat bland and the desserts were equally uninspiring
- the Spinning Bowl Salad which has been a hallmark of theirs for decades felt a little dated...like who still uses Thousand Island-ish dressing anymore?

Overall still love coming back to Lawry's from time to time because the stuff they do well they do really well, but if you're not a roast beef / steak person you probably shouldn't come here.",pos

"Valentine's Day 2023. Came in with my husband and had two serving of warm bread provided to us (cos the wait staff forgot and brought another to us), followed by the foie gras which was above average and interesting paired with the citrus fruits... Waited for about 50mins till the next course of soup which was provided to us at room temperature (after I prompted the wait staff that we were waiting for our meal), followed by the oyster which was nice. The main course we took, the prime rib, stood out as expected (but the Yorkshire pudding only came after I finished my meal). The desserts were average - blue lagoon was a little bit better (lighter and sweeter) then the denser red velvet cake.

The waiting time was unnecessarily long with food being mostly average with the main and the foie gras being the only things that stood out from the whole 6 course meal. The presentation of the food was also not as clean with soup bowl being presented to us with soup marks all around the circumference of the bowl.",neutral

Only fixed to fries and I do not eat fries. Also, the steak tartare looked and tasted like it was the first time the chef ever made one.

Scampi Prawn in pasta was not cooked n quite raw (staff were informed about it). Sashimi was terribly haphazardly sliced n some sashimi slices didn‚Äôt taste fresh. Please do away with all stuff squid dishes as they do not keep well on a buffet line. Lobsters and river prawns were overcooked dry and tough. Grilled Lobsters tasted as if they were already precooked by supplier before grilling - very very different quality from the grilled lobsters we had at Colony previously. grilled lobster quality dropped significantly. If lobsters were fresh and raw they would have been able to accommodate my request for lobster to be steamed instead of grilled.When I asked they said all lobster was already cooked so cx steam. No more crispy beancurd roll for laksa and gravy for laksa isn‚Äôt as good as previously. Oysters didn‚Äôt taste so fresh and I had diarrhea 5 times within a few hours after eating the food. Overall disappointing as food standard has drastically declined while prices have gone up.,neg

We ordered one set of dinner to share. Starter and main dish both tasted good.

There were only a handful of staff for the crowd. Those with reservations were asked to queue with those without. We could not get the buffet ourselves but the counter was often unmanned.

"Not the only prime rib roast in town, but one of the best. The sight of the chunky roast carved tableside oozing juices would leave one drooling. Take a thicker and rarer cut to enjoy the full flavour of the luscious beef, and sparingly with the saltier sauce.

The spinning salad bowl was more optics than taste. The crispy, fluffy Yorkshire pudding was a welcomed complement. Responsive service, posh ambiance and Orchard Road locale translate into a high-price point not for regular Sunday roast diners, but for an occasion or a treat.",pos
F&B is not cheap but it's the music that keeps us coming back.,pos

"The star spinning salad was a disappointment this time. Too much dressing and the server didn't spin enough, and just did it for the sake of doing. It wasn't as enjoyable as before. Everything else was good, up to standards, just the salad that I looked forward to, was very disappointing.",neg
Service was impeccable. The service staff made my birthday a memorable one for my family and I. A must visit for succulent beef prime ribs if you are willing to splurge some. Have a good day!,pos
Fantastic truffle bread and pasta. Crackling pork with mustard the best,pos
"Always a pleasant experience with iO. Was here for a mate‚Äôs birthday dinner and called in earlier to request they do a simple ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù note on the tiramisu (one of the best around!) and they went above and beyond.

Great portions and tasty. Slightly disappointed that the breaded fishdidn‚Äôt taste fresh,pos
"My best steak experience this year. Pricey? Definitely. But its all worth it. Great for celebrations, or even dining in by yourself. Lawrys cut was fabulous, full of flavour and the beefy taste is out of this world. The lobster was extremely fresh and the condiments go well with it. Service staff are attentive and friendly, adding on the the good vibes. 10/10 would come again.",pos
Our truffle fries n steak are good. The rib is kinda messy (don‚Äôt quite know where to sink my knife) and the dish looks a bottle gross after a while with mangled meat n bones. ‚Ä¶,neutral

Great good but a little overpriced. Surprisingly crowded for a neighbourhood place,pos
Good steak and nice interior,pos
"Went for the lunch set at 79++.

Got a really basic salad, cold bread roll for starter and and a mediocre slice of strawberry cake for dessert.

The roast beef which was its specialty failed to impress me. It was also cold (perhaps meant to be served that way) and really thinly sliced.

Frankly for the price I could have gone for a hotel buffet and left with enough money to take a taxi home.

The staff were all super polite, though I'm essentially paying $5 a thank you here, seeing the food I received.",neg

Not to be missed - the Roman stuffed schiacciata. Will definitely return to try their other dishes.,pos
"Ribs Ribs n more Ribs galore - a wonderful night out at Lawry‚Äôs whose menu naturally had a rib selection of cuts with delectable sides of mash, Yorkshire pud n the all famous spinning salad with cuts being done to a perfection of medium rare. For those otherwise inclined there was fish, steaks, lamb n pork each done in a definitive style. Wine selection was impressive although it would have been better with a wider selection of new world vintages. Starters were innovative n surprisingly tasteful with seafood being fresh, foie gras done to perfection n crab cakes crunchy n meat balls well sauced. The sweets and desserts were delectable n well plated. My personal call was for the infamous mud pie dangerous in calories but obviously worth the sacrifice. Service was attentive although table selection could have been improved upon enquiry by attending staff. I disagree with many others who grade service as ‚Äúnice n friendly‚Äù as opposed to service was professional n helpful the latter of which I believe is what starred restaurants strive to achieve. The on table serving of the cuts could also have been improved upon with a slight verbal introduction as opposed to a ninja like approach with no one noticing the chef n the arrival of the roast wagon -  a pity ! All in a gastronomical night out in wonderful ambience with good decor, good food, good wine n always good company. A small suggestion- the sauce for the ribs was slightly thinned n it was, if I remember correctly, more gruel like in the past n with a stronger beefy aroma. That would have placed the ribs at an absolute stellar level. Nuff said Lawry‚Äôs the Prime Rib - highly recommended n we are poised for a rematch in the not too distant future üòå ahhh last but not least the surprise slice of birthday lime sorbet cake was the cherry for the last star in this review.",pos
Food and ambience is amazing. Highly recommended it.True Italian experience!,pos

The quality of food is not as nice anymore except for the hot fudge sundae which is still outstanding. The beef lacked flavor and the sides were basic. It‚Äôs been one of our go to restaurants for years but it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll come back as the food is just not worth the price anymore.,neg

"I've had a great time dining here for dinner last night! Service itself was very fast considering the fact that it was quite full house and very friendly as well. Steak itself was good and the sides were great too! Thou it is a bit steep, still worth it for the experience I would say! Not too bad at all!",pos
Service was good.  Staff were all helpful and efficient. We loved the ambience and food very much.,pos
"A bit sad to see many recent negative reviews as we really liked their steak, Yorkshire pudding, and cream spinach. However, the visit today truly deserve a one star.

Giving it a 4-star because the previous visits had all been great, except for today.

We really hoped they are not taking their food and service quality for granted because their online rating is good and they think they can do whatever and people would still spend hundreds of dollar for one meal there.

Overall, we observed that their seasonal menu is not great, so we stick to their traditional prime rib dinner and stopped having seasonal items. It hasn't disappointed us, until today.

The baking department simply did not bring their A-game to the table today. The buns were at the edge of being burnt, and Yorkshire pudding oh Yorkshire pudding üíî it was  eggy, rubbery (texture), and also at the edge of being burnt. Half of my medium steak was dry and well-done. But at least the hubby's medium rare steak was great.

We're not gonna go during or anywhere near holiday seasons again. Maybe post Valentine's Day. Hopefully the food will be good again.",pos
food was good. however it was crowded and slightly understafded,pos

Maybe lunch crowd but they don‚Äôt peel their eyes for new walk ins and as they move about dining floor, their eyes are not trained to pick up patrons who needed help. It‚Äôs quite frustrating. Twice it happened and  the most irksome was placing order on the app which apparently didn‚Äôt work and no one mentioned. Needs to improve",neg

Mona gave us great service. Very nice person.,pos
Great food!,pos
"Review based on sharing food among 3 pax.
(1) Duck Confit with Foie Gras ($29++): A repeat purchase! Perfectly cooked - crispy skin with rich, tender meat and a delicate hint of herbs.
(2) Katong Lobster Roll ($30++): A fusion. A laksa-marinated lobster and avocado. The flavors complemented well, though it leaned more eggy than lobstery. The toasted, warm bun and extra crispy fries were excellent.
(3) House Special Wings (7pcs, $15++): Crispy skin and tender meat, but nothing stood out - no unique sauce or flavors. Best eaten hot.

A solid spot for small plates with standout dishes, though stick to their signature items for the best experience.",neutral

Price is cheaper compared to others for the same food. Quality isreasonably good,pos
"Service was good but overall food was a little disappointing. We were expecting more after reading all the great reviews online. Tried one of the chef's recommendation- it was some pasta, nothing special, overpriced and the penne was undercooked. Calamari was a letdown. However the Porchetta, Assorted bread and Schiacciata were really good.",neutral
The place I‚Äôve been returning for fresh & authentic Italian dishes.,pos
Awesome food at the restaurant especially the schiacciata and pizza. Prices are reasonable but not exactly cheap. Restaurant is noisy as they cram in as many tables as possible in a small location.,pos
Excellent service by Ansil and Siena. Keep up the great work. Very warm and friendly made our day.,pos
Delicious and tasty meals üòã,pos
For a supposedly fine dinning resto nickle and dimming your customers is crazy. Charging 10 dollars for tap water. The lamb abit smelly too. Prime ribs are still okay not as special as it use to be. After over 20 years going here this will be my last time.,neutral
"Total 5 pax but each of our dish was served in stages in probably 20 mins intervals with the last dish being served more than an hour ..the only best dish to mention here was the chicken chop. Miso cod is not worth the price. Music was way.too loud. Was told they couldn't lower it down cause they don't control the volume? Didn't understand that but we were offered a private room instead. 
However, saving grace were the servers..Amy and Hakim made sure they checked in on us, apologised for the delay and gave us free desserts.

May try again to give it a second shot.",neg

"Nice place for rib steaks with good service and helpful staff. Their food is good, but quite simple. Their steaks consist of one very large rib which they cut table side based on your size preference. Their wine list is quite limited. Also, if you pay with Citibank credit card, there's a 40% discount on food items which is a good promotion. And it's everybody's birthday there... get prepared to hear the happy birthday song many times (they probably have some kind of promotion for people celebrating their birthday there).",pos

However, their pipe in songs is played pretty loud and making it difficult to have a proper conversation or to dine peacefully.

We had to struggle to listen to the conversation when the songs was pretty loud.
It was not a pleasant experience.",neg

"I was at Lawry‚Äôs on 6 Nov 2021 to celebrate my sister‚Äôs birthday. Strongly felt the poor service experienced there.  Servers are so robotics without passion at work.
1. Bowl salad n bread pudding explanation were carried out  with no eye-contact at all, looking elsewhere n talking to the air.
2. At ordering, when my guest informed doneness of steak, waitress asked to relay later during steak preparation time but the same one attended to us again that we need to hold back earlier!!! Rude to cut customers off impolitely.
3. On the sides, they did not take note during our order n when serving steak, they asked us what sides, who can recall what sides on the menu. .
4. On the side plate, no refill of bread roll is fine but neither cleared the plate nor butter knife when we put a distant away. When we requested to clear to make way for the main course steak, no apologetic response nor willing gesture rendered. Isn‚Äôt the table-setting be ever ready & organised prior respective course served?
5. What are the condiments on the table use for that were not explained at all.
6. Dessert served were without side plates n left without a word and we needed to ask to include  birthday cake.  (It was mentioned at the reservation of a birthday celebration weeks ahead).
7. Desserts were hurriedly cleared without fully consumed. When my guest was taken aback for the disruption, appetite was vanished to hold back.
8. Bill processing was overlooked and much time wasted waiting.
9. We  were provided with a form to fill, in order to receive the digital photo taken by Lawry.  The Birthday form (2-sided) were atrociously printed and words were barely clear in font size 8 with faded printing as though printer is out of ink, and in slanted format on page 2, words in sentence was cut off.  So we don‚Äôt bother to fill 100% to more than 15 questions therein because Lawry‚Äôs form condition showed much insincerity in attaining customers‚Äô valuable response.
It is a poor dining experience for me and my sister, we were disappointed. Except for the food, service level is truly lacking.",neg

Really enjoyed the food! Would recommend 4 people coming here to try out more food together.
We ordered the Porchetta which we really liked. The skin was crackled to perfection. Highly recommended. 
The pistachio tiramisu (no longer in a jar) was good! Slightly to the sweeter side. Recommend to share. 

Atmosphere can be a little more to the noisy side due to families being there.",pos
Had been there a couple of times so generally know what to expect. Good for just casual dining but items a little expensive for the main course.,neutral

I ask to heat up the steak and it naturally affect the doneness of the steak.  So I didn't really enjoy my food.",neg
"One of my favorite beef places. The prime rib is very good, with various sizes for different appetites, ranging from 130g all the way to a gargantuan 450g. The entire dining experience was very good as well. Service was attentive, ambience is comfortable, and there is complimentary cake for your birthday month. Prices are on the high side, but there are some promotions that will bring it to a more reasonable range.",pos
This place always never disappoint. Food quality is consistently good.,pos

"My 3rd visit to Lawrys Prime Rib and I am never disappointed with their beef. We had to take the Valentine's Day menu and the first 4 dishes were not as good. Especially the mozzarella cheese, it doesn't seems to fit into the 7 course menu. More effort can definitely be done in redesigning the menu. Both the main course are great, chicken stew is delicious, chicken is very soft and well seasoned. Beef as usual is everything you would expect from Lawry.

"Singapore cut (130g) ($85) - Enjoyed the end cut prime rib (well done). The dish came with salad, mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, horseradish and whipped cream. The salad was mainly lettuce though there was a small amount of tiny, diced beetroot, a couple of cherry tomatoes, croutons, bit of egg yolk from hard boiled egg, with a dressing that was similar to thousand island though slightly spicier.
Creamed spinach ($13) - ok.
Attentive service.",pos

Spaghetti was small and lacking ingredients  for the price. Mushroomsoup was spoiled. Sour tasting.,neutral
It was very crowded and even needed to queue if go without reservation because of TGIF. However Chef Anna served customers personally! Had the seafood guazzetto again. So gooood.,pos
Love the creamy Hojicha Latte very much! Great service too by Camille and her team,pos
The mushroom soup and my order of chicken was salty; both the butter rice and the accompanying gravy. I had to force myself to finish it since I recommended it to my family due to its good ratings. Disappointed :(,neg

Main highlight is the service, very friendly and helpful",neutral

Atmosphere is great and wait staff are friendly. They were helpful in recommendations of good food to try from the menu. The orecchiette with pork sausage and saffron sauce is one of the best pasta dishes I've had in singapore. Planning to visit again soon to try different types of pasta.,pos

"Their meal is expensive, but value for money. I don't know other restaurants who serve such a tender and juicy roasted beef.
I have never tried other items than the roasted beef. I would like to try them next time.",pos
"For the food:
1. The salad mostly vegetables with little raisins. 
2. The brownie is nice but very tiny. Really wish restaurant cd hv been more generous due to the National Day package. 
For the service:
1. The server does not provide a spoon/fork for our brownies. They cleared the main dishes fast including the cutlery. So we had to ask for it. Seems like they are cutting corners and not being considerate/thoughtful to diners.
2. Servers did not automatically provide milk for my coffee. Again, I feel that they are cutting corners and had to ask for it 
Due to the food portion and the slackened service as compared to other restaurants, this will be my 1st and last visit. Restaurant should train their staff to add more personal touch to customers.",neg

"Great variety of food.
Reasonable pricing. Portion is sufficient.
Risotto is abit salty though",pos

Ice cream pints were not well packed. Reached me and it was so softand melted. Even the dry ice didn‚Äôt help. Swensens need to pack icecream in ice vacuum bag.,neutral

An open see through kitchen concept of dining. On a hot afternoon the restaurant‚Äôs air conditioning could do better. Pastas and pizzas are best in here,pos
We enjoyed the food but just that it took close to an hour to be served. The staff did provide complimemantry chips and dips. The lamb rack was nicely done!,neg
"the restaurant itself may seem small, and variety of food selection is relatively limited. 
brought my mum for a lunch buffet on 25 Oct, and wanted her to purely enjoy, however, prawns were not as freshed and we had to wait in line for oysters to be served. 
signature seafood laksa and the prawn noodle soup is good to go. 
but for some food items, like acar, there were to salty to begin with. 

staffs were very nice and approachable, however i think the service could be better, for instance, i asked for the drinks menu, and it only arrived 20 minutes later, and the drinks ordered was served more than 10 minutes later as well.",neg

Ordered white asparagus but was undercooked leaving a strong bitter taste. Kind prawn Aglio olio was bland as well. Feel like Jewel branch standard isn‚Äôt on par with other PS cafe.,neg
"Generally food of good quality but mains (crabmeat prawn pasta) too small portion. Buffet had too many egg base food types. We had to help ourselves to water, bring our used dishes to the waitresses & go to counter to settle our bills, they were too occupied & insufficient staff allocated to do these services. Felt very ‚Äòrush‚Äô to eat in this restaurant.",neg
Always love their stuff. Favourites being hand cut potatoes for appetisers and the linguine pesto and truffle taglioni for mains. Their cakes are amazing and I‚Äôd also recommend the pistachio tiramisu!,pos

The quality and taste of the pizza is not up to the standard that it usedto set prior to the restaurant moving (closing?). Crust is dry andtasteless. Sauce didn‚Äôt taste of much. Toppings (ham) looke,neg

I just feel let down after spending 32 dollars on a burger and enjoying it less than fast food options. Seafood pasta was okay, the noodles almost al dente which is rare in Singapore so that was good. Prawns did not taste good to me.",neg

There‚Äôre better options at One Fullerton and nearby. Will skip PS Cafe if possible in the future.",neg
Excellent atmosphere for a celebration meal. The beef are awesome. Even comes with a free photograph for remembrance.,pos

restaurant is a bit hot during mid day dining. Also mentioned to staff which mentioned that it is under central aurcon by hotel so can't do anything. suggest installing some fans.,pos

Great food! Great service! Will definitely go again. üòÉ,pos
Sauce was a little too diluted,pos
Best place for Christmas brunch.,pos

Celebrated my kids' birthdays here. Service staff was helpful with plates for the cake. Food was good. Will come back,neutral
It was a wet Sunday morning. The staff on duty were very kind and didn‚Äôt make bother me while I sat with a latte waiting for my 3 friends. Everyone was late from the heavy traffic.

They used to sing their traditional Lawry‚Äôs birthday song (was excited to let my daughter hear it), but we didn‚Äôt get to experience it during our recent dine in. The birthday cake, which was in the form of a cupcake with loads of whipped cream, was also rather underwhelming. Food portion seems smaller and the service was also not as good as the last time I visited too. But there was a lady in a black coat who saved the day towards the end of our dining experience by offering excellent service and helping us in taking nice family photos.",neg
Excellent French Food! Quality Ingredients and Super Service!,pos
Food is not good as 10 yrs ago. But service make me give them 5 stars.,pos

Service recovery is great with complimentary prime rib for us to try",pos

Had the Lawry's signature steak. Was tender and juicy. Cooking style is slow boiled rather than grilled. Excellent service :),pos
Food was decent.,neutral
"not worth.

If you're buying steaks they serve you cuts that are very thin and seared on one side. Doesn't even come with salt as seasoning. Food gets cold almost immediately since ac is too cold and plates arent warmed. Ribs are tender and taste good, but for $100 I was expecting better.",neg
"First time visit to the place. Tad disappointted with the mains and the bread. Was supposed to be warm but probably we are seated near aircon, the bread turn cold and nothing to wow for. 
The cookie danish was too hard for myself and hashbrowns were more 'air' and crisp than real filling. 

What's good is the Granola choices and the chocolate balls.",neg

"Front of house lady was excellent, didn't get her name.",pos
"Excellent service. Great steak. Nice and tender. Tried the 200gm beef on the wagon. For an average Singaporean that should be more than enough. If you want to splurge once in a while, then worth a visit but it would burn a small hole in the average person's pocket.",pos
"Great ambience, with 360 view.
However was disappointed with the dress code. Saw ppl with shorts and exercise pants in the venue as well as 2 kids running around chased after by their grand mother. The dress code and children policy wasn‚Äôt enforced.",pos

Soup had chunky beef but was bland. The angus beef was pretty good. The chocolate sauce gave a nice touch to the beef which was a tad salty. Rib eye steak with truffle fries was also salty. Also had the dessert buffet, was a bit disappointed with the spread. Would be better off going ala carte and going for the other cakes/brownies.",neg
"SHAM one of the waiters seemed overworked and under a lot of pressure, short of time too, his service was rushed, borderline rude, and rough.  At first we weren‚Äôt even given the table which we had requested for in our online booking, which was to be by the window.  We then asked to change our table and it was like such a big ask for this Sham.  Eventually he said we could change the table. He transferred our plates over but not the cutlery holder.  Two other female waitresses also plonked down the dishes loudly onto the table and rushed off.  Really bad service. Understaffed. Jaded staff.  Hardly a pleasure to dine there if not for the truffle fries.",neg
Taste is below average,neg
The bacon was overcooked so asked the waitor to exchange which was taken care eventually.,neg
Didn't receive it,neg
Ms Apple is very friendly & welcoming with her service. Food are nice and big serving.,pos
Definitely the food needs to be improved. Although to be fair to them we only texted a few of their dishes,neutral
Amazing as always! The food here just puts you in a good mood. Tried the carbonara this time and it was really deliciously eggy. The pork bits could be crunchier but this is already a cut above the rest,pos
Nice ambience.,pos
"Very good food, love their vegetarian burgers",pos
"Afternoon tea crockery looked cheap, like common buffet line. Would have been nicer if the tea cups and teapot were more exquisite.

Savoury set was nice. It would be nice to include laksa or mee siam to neutralise the sweets.",neutral
"We ordered their tomahawk medium but it came medium rare, with an overly strong gaminess which wasn‚Äôt to our taste, so much so we couldn‚Äôt finish it. The sides were decent, but not spectacular. Favourite part of the meal was the bacon starter, but they could have toned down the seasoning a little. 

I had indicated an anniversary celebration in my reservation but that was also overlooked. Other than that, the service staff were friendly and helpful.",neg

The environment is beautiful. 
The service is also very good. 
I will come back here again.",neutral
"Great service, ambience and food, food came fast too! Loved it and will definitely return next time! Thanks for the lovely evening with my friends~",pos
"Service was great as always, but the overall experience is getting stale, which is disappointing for a restaurant with such legacy. There is not much flexibility for customers with dietary requirements or requests, even in swapping out a side for another side item and us willing to pay the difference. With the increasing number of other food establishments going the extra mile, for meals that cost much less than meals here, I won't miss not returning.",neutral

"I had a lot more expectations considering the reviews on tripadvisor and some friends, was disappointed compared to that, specially for vegetarian options. We had the stuffed Roman Schiacciata that was quite nice. We also ordered the Hand cut potatoes, rock salt and rosemary that a bit too burnt and sweet for our liking. We went on to ordering a pesto linguini- the pasta was a bit too al dente and the sauce did not have enough 'hit' of basil in it. Had to add salt to taste in both the pasta and the rosemary potato. The best dish was the dessert-Pistachio Tiramisu- it was soft and still held its shape and was delicious. Overall ok, just not great! In terms of service I thought they came to ask us for next order too soon, one after another. should leave us alone and we can ask. There was another guy who was always hovering around the table to clear things or see if we needed anything, but felt intrusive.",neutral
"We were wow with the best selling dishes, pleasant to taste and sight! Not forgetting the range of pastries, so beautiful!",pos
"Second visit, very good experience. Staff has recommended new menu, it so tasty.",pos
Pizza was excellent. Also love the lasagne and the meatballs. The risotto in lobster sauce was good but too salty. Everything is very affordable except for the dessert which is $14 for a slice vs $18 can get you a very good plate of lasagne. Will return to try other dishes,pos
Wonderful brunch in this place especially Ryan made our day!,pos
The beef and pork chop was too dry and hard.,neg
"Food was not nice, it‚Äôs just like eating fast food but a lot more expensive. Some fast food burgers taste better than this. Coffee was not served hot, not even warm. Prob sitting at counter for a long time. Desserts were absolutely yucky.",neg
"My husband and I came in with oysters and lobster empty at the buffet spread. When it was refilled, it was done one by one. If you charge more than $100 for the buffet, why do we not have the spread we pay for? Our plates were also not changed when we were done and had to ask waiters to change them. We also had to ask for oysters. Is this really the standard of a 5 star hotel?",neg
The rosa penne is overrated has a weird aftertaste may be better for vegetarians as it tasted very vegetarian despite me ordering the chicken option ‚Ä¶ burger and fries were the star of the show,neg

"I think the Lawry‚Äôs in Singapore just falls short - the prime rib itself was pretty good, but the rest of the food was so undeserving of the price tag. I had a lobster bisque which was full of MSG (and starch) and it was 20 odd dollars. The salad was tossed heavily in a thousand island sauce and the creamed spinach was bland. Honestly, other than the rib, everything tasted quite like cafeteria food, and for a meal that was $360 for two, I expected a higher quality of food. The staff was attentive polite and nice though!",neutral
"Over-rated, overly expensive and hot like an oven. The food was decent but honest overly priced. At least they served free ice water. Yes, I get it that it's pet-friendly but there are many other pet-friendly places and your pets will thank you.",neg

Did not see the restaurant‚Äôs message and got to the restaurant and fortunately, there was a table within 10, 15 mins. however, was then told that half the items on the menu were not available which could have been told to me whilst i was waiting for the table so that i can decide whether i still wanted to eat there. eventually left without eating",neg

 Appreciate the fusion cuisine but average to taste.  Truffle fries have hardly any truffle smell.  It‚Äôs like eating regular shoestring fries with shaved Parmesan cheese.",neg

Excellent food. It never fails my expectations! The staff are superb!,pos
"If you seek steak, then seek prime! How can you not love the way the serve the ribs that has been well marinated the core and cooked so well by the chef that the meat just peels of easily where you can savour the juices in your mouth. A medium well that's so juicy, unlikely any steaks I've tried. Beware to order something lesser than the regular size unless you've the stomach to down all that meat and stuff. It comes with their famous spinning salad which I think would be nice if it could 'sing' and then will be a 'singing' salad, it'll sure add to the experience! Waitress and waiters are alert and good service. I felt like at home with a butler on hand. Their soup is rich and tasty. Don't forget the lamb for those who are not into beef ... the truffles lingers... wonderful. Will o be heading back? Bet I will. Their monthly special might be worth the buck to have a try if it's your first time. Pamper yourself a little, enjoy the ambience and experience You'll love it!",pos

Celebrated my son' s 13th birthday at Lawry's (at his request) and he was treated like a King!  The service was impeccable and as always the food delicious...  we left a happy family...  Thanks Lawry's,pos
"The staff were friendly and helpful. To be fair it wasn't busy so we are not sure how the service would have been otherwise. Loved the style with lots of plants, some were real. What was an added bonus were the two young musicians who played for us, sang so well and played the guitar. Very understated but lovely. I would prefer to tip them directly but not sure how to do that subtly. Considering how limited Singapore is on spaces for bands/singers singing retro songs this place is great for that too. Easy to get to from Bugis MRT and on the fringe of busy Kampong Glam.",neutral
"had a wonderful lunch there with the amex dining vouchers.  had the lawry cut, med rare and it was very pleasing. Great place to dine at. staff is great, they know the food and if you are having issues deciding,  ask the staff for recommendations.

overall I really like this place and I will come back for more.

So I went back again the other day on amex love dining, really worth it. Had the Lawry's cut again and it's still very good. I think the way to enjoy yourself is to book at odd hours. We book for 445pm and after everything, we left at 6pm. Really great experience.",pos

"I visited at the arrangement of a colleague, and there was also a la carte, but I heard that the restaurant was selling roast beef, so I ordered the ``August 4-course set ($139)''. In my personal opinion, the starter salad had a bit too much dressing, and the appetizer, fried soft shell crab, was sweet and a bit sticky. As expected, the roast beef that was carved in front of me was delicious. The interior is gorgeous and the staff's customer service is very polite, which is why I gave it a 5 star, but the two appetizers were not good enough, so I gave it a 4 star.",pos
We ordered only 2 items that amount to 20 plus yet they send wrongchicken instead of spicy we got normal and the fries came soggy withlittle cheese and chicken taste so bland. I m surprise singa,neg
"Great food as always! The place is a bit crowded though and the waiters are always too busy to notice us. Except for that, all perfect!",pos
Seated very quickly and food was delivered promptly. Suggested improvement for the restaurant is perhaps not to seat other customers so closely to each other when clearly there are other open spaces around.,pos

"Was hectic in the restaurant and the staff were swamped, but we had comfy seats and enjoyed our lunch there. Nice atmosphere, nice decor.",pos
Cosy place for a meal,neutral
"This place is all about showmanship other than the good beef cuts. From the 'maid costumes', 'chef badges' and the big toss salad bowl...the price you pay is for the entertainment rather than good food.

The salad is substandard for the price, the dressing too sour, the veg used is just some common lettuce, cherry tomatoes... most caf√©s and restaurants serve better salad compared to Lawry's.

Perhaps a good place to show off your wealth, to entertain your clients and to impress whoever you wanna impress.  Otherwise, for good steaks and roast beef, there are still many good steak houses around at half of their prices.

Look out for dining promotions, it's only worth the try when you have special vouchers.  Even then, with discount, be prepared to spend at least $150 / pax for a simple lunch.",neg

"Where to start...
Lawry's was packed the night we went, full of families celebrating and couples dining. I can only assume it is because Lawry's are sitting on their laurels and the fact it's in a prime location on Orchard, because it sure ain't because of the food.
Lawry's tries really hard to be a fine dining institution (with the prices to match) but forgets the basics like offering guests water when seated. There is a lot of pomp in the presentation - driving around a giant metal cart to cut the beef by your tableside, and making a spectacle out of the salad preparation - however it does nothing to add to the flavour of the food. The service is fine but could use a bit more finesse.
The food itself - the rib eye is sinewy, the captain's cut tastes like a generic buffet rotisserie that's sliced in front of you - it still tastes fine, but lower the price to 1/3 of what it is then I'd have no qualms. The creamed spinach tastes like frozen packet spinach and the serve is incredibly small. The lobster bisque tasted like something you could whip up yourself from a packet.
We went on a Wednesday which already has 30% off some dishes - it was still overpriced.
The highlight was the complimentary birthday cake slice, which I confirmed was baked in house. That was delicious. And the photo gift was appreciated to commemorate the celebration.
I would avoid this place to save a good $500 and spend it elsewhere (apparently CUT! is the place to go to eat good steak in Singapore).",neg
Rose was excellent as the host.,pos

Something should be done to change the set up for more flow",pos

Only then that she activated the dinner online menu.",neg
"Reliable international chain for prime rib (I had the 300g Lawry‚Äôs cut) and their famous spinning bowl salad (who doesn‚Äôt like a bit of drama and flair with their lunch service?). Meat is cut table-side from a silver trolley, and all (lovely and friendly) staff are dressed in slightly OTT anachronistic old-fashioned uniforms.

Got the Lawry's primerib and overall was tender and juicy. Not a big prime rib fan but enjoyed this one. We got the truffles fries, froi gras, and the 3 split veggie dish.

They also provided a small cake for his birthday and sang.

Service:
Was very attentive and almost never needed to ask for anything as they filled out wines and waters very quickly. They manager also came around to check n how everything was.

"I had Christmas dinner here with my family tonight. It was an utter disappointment. For the Soup course, we were served chicken consomm√© with Japanese gyoza. After one bite of the gyoza, we felt that something was off. My mother, my brother and I are allergic to prawns and we were getting concerned. We called the waiter over and told him about our allergy but he insisted that the gyoza contained no prawns, only chicken. In disbelief, we took a remaining gyoza apart and showed him a large piece of prawn. However, the waiter took one look and said it was chicken. At our insistence, he went to the kitchen to double check. When he came back to the table, without even apologising, he offered a mushroom soup as a replacement. Only after being pressed did he acknowledge that the gyoza contained prawns. But he immediately insisted that we had not indicated our dietary restrictions in our booking. He had zero concern for our health even after being told that he had served us a food item we were allergic to.

Any restaurant should know what is in their food, and should state ingredients such as seafood or peanuts clearly. People make mistakes but there is just no excuse for their response.",neg
"Not the best service; usually much better; one particular staff member was clearly not having a good day! Flow in service was, in general, lacking tonight.",neg
"My husband and I really enjoyed our meal at Lawry's along with our baby girl. It was my husband's birthday and while the meal was a little pricey, the birthday promotion made it worth while.

It was the first time we bring our daughter to eat out at a restaurant and clearly she enjoyed the decor, ambience and the amazing crew's service. We will definitely be back again and we want to make it a yearly affair to come back to celebrate my husband's birthday.

Food was great! & they helped you to take a family photo as well. It was memorable üíñ  thank you for the amazing service.",pos

"Managed to get a reservation only at 3pm and it was still quite packed! Used the chope set menu and they were really professional and very fuss free!

The salad was really good and they mixed the sauce in really well. The Singapore cut portion was just nice. Really really good roast beef. But the dessert was really uninspired, they could really do much better with it. Felt a little like a store bought cake. Would recommend to just go for the ice cream.",pos
"Found a long strand of hair in my hrnne chicken burger.Servers were notified and they immediately offered a change.However,not only did we have to wait for 25min for the replacement which clearly was not prioritized as an urgent service recovery,but they also didnt offer to waive off the cost of the meal.Appetite was lost and the mood was ruin.They only waived the cost of the burger alone and that was after I insisted.Very dissapointed.It was my regular go to plc but never again will I step in here.",neg
Great steak and lobsters,pos
My fave Pet Cafe!,pos

"One of the restaurants on my bucket list. Surely the cheese platters recommended did not disappoint us! Especially the apple wood cheddar and truffle Gouda was of great taste to the palate and matches the white wine recommended. Mala chicken pops is addictive. Scallop Angels hair pasta was a bit oily. 
Staff were politely and patient. Environment like all other reviews crowded and gets very noisy in the evening, you can hardly conversation properly. Also do note there is a 90mins dine in time. The restaurant could have done better with guest coming after work hours with laptop etc. like having a bag basket or hangers would be helpful. Would I be back to dine again? Probably not in the evening, it is just a mission impossible to properly chilled out bec you need to speak on top of yr voice and stick your heads close to yr friends so that you can hear. If this doesn‚Äôt affect you, it is a great plc with great cheese and wine. But surely will be back to get take away cheese.",neg
Service was not very prompt and not much initiative from staff. There were 4 of us and she only brought 3 glasses and we had to ask another staff for additional glass. We were seated in a corner and it was so hard to get help.,neg
Attentive service especially shout out to Evelyn. Nice ambience! PS cafe food never disappoint. We had a wonderful time celebrating my daughter's birthday at the cafe!,neutral
"The worst steakhouse ever
Salad was bad looks like they prepared it a day before.
When I come to steak this is the first time I eat steak that was cooked to someone else, the steak was cooked before when they served it it was cold. I have had steak all over but never had steak like this before it was the worst streak house experience",neg
Service was great as usual even though it was lunch hour but the lamb wasn't as good as the prime steak. The steak of course was good as usual,pos

This hidden restaurant is an absolute gem. The service and quality of the cooking are 10/10. I didn‚Äôt get the name of the gentleman manager who served us - he served with heart and genuine warmth and hospitality. Already planning to bring family and friends to Alice again!,pos
The music of too loud. Many of the customers want a relax and quiet coffee-shop type of environment. The music is too loud for chatting with friends or a lone relaxed time.,neg
Great food and awesome wine. Rahman and Juriah were both polite when serving customers!,pos

Ambience overall was fantastic. Not overly pretentious or bourgeois, so still puts people at ease.",pos
"It might just be the best pork chop I've had in my life! I've never eaten a pork chop this tender and juicy, like a tonkatsu kind of cut, since they are usually on the drier and tougher side.

Yorkshire pudding was great as usual,pos

We come to the restaurant once a month as the food was usually very good. But today the food is either too salty or not salty or too much pepper. The worst was the king prawn alio olio as the spaghetti was tasteless. The french fries used to be irresistible but today we could not finish as the fries are not of the usual standard.,neg

Service was good, portions were large and the dining room atmosphere was nice and relaxed.

With that said, though I enjoyed the prime rib here, I have had better in Las Vegas which also cost much much less.

The food was still very good but I think the main draw card here is the dining experience and ambience.",pos

It has been a while since I had Lawry‚Äôs and it is still as good as I remembered. The prime rib is still the best I had. The service is also great. I definitely recommend you to go for the smaller cut though. It can be pretty overwhelming with all the appetizers and side dishes.,pos

This time, we came on a Friday evening with a couple of friends who were celebrating their wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, the staff decided not to take more orders after 9:25pm, even though the restaurant was still full. They even declined to serve us another glass of wine, since they were rushing to close the place. I believe they could be more flexible regarding their closing hours, this would pass on a better impression of their service and would be highly appreciated by customers.",pos
Had a quick lunch date with friend and simply love the stuffed Roman schiacciata and chocolate Lava cake.,pos

"Made a reservation for the weekend brunch and was excited to visit. A few things did not go smoothly during our visit 
1. Despite having a reservation, we waited in line for 15 mins. When we were shown to our table, the set up was very odd as we were next to a table of 3 who were directly facing us (they were seated in 1 line). It made conversations awkward 
2. The restaurant was busy and servers were too occupied. We waited for a long time to put in our order and our request for water never arrived until we went up to the service desk to request for it again
3. Food quality was below expectations. The buffet spread had a mix of savory and sweet items but nothing was outstanding. We ordered Parma ham eggs benefit for our main course and it was awful. My partner‚Äôs dish arrived and there was no egg yolk; the egg yolk on mine was fully cooked. There was little to no hollandaise sauce too. The restaurant kindly redid my partner‚Äôs dish

Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be back‚Ä¶",neg
Impeccable service and food was delectable,pos
Warm service and great ambience with live music! Perfect to chill out with family and friends in a more private space while enjoying good food!

"First time eating Lawry's, it was in Los Angeles almost 23 years ago. The taste still the same, really amazing, the most I like it's lawrys cut. It's big, tender and juicy especially the brown sauce, never enough.
I love the way they make the spinning bowl  ball salad.

The creamy corn vegetables bit sweet but if you like sweet taste, this is good too...
The staff very friendly and kind.
You need to make reservations for dinner, it's full house when I got there.

Outstanding Service all round,pos
"Good service, good food. The restaurant decor has the classic feels. It also has very large windows which makes it bright and inviting.

Their signature is the prime rib roast. Before serving the salad, a plate of salad, that is tossed in the spinning bowl table side, will be served. The vegetables were fresh and the dressing was also quite good. Some seasoned pepper can also be added to balance out the creaminess from the dressing. There is also some bread roll and butter.

The prime rib is then carved table-side as well. The Lawry's Cut is very thick, but despite being so, the meat is very tender and is still very juicy. The mashed potato was good, the corn was good, and the creamed spinach was particularly good as it wasn't too creamy. It was also served with Yorkshire pudding, which is good to clean up the sauces in the plate.

They also have their in-house sommelier which can recommend wines from their wine list that suits to your preference.",pos

"I have been to Marmalade Pantry many times but not in the last 6 months or so. This is by far my worst experience. The crispy barramundi came with curried potatoes, what tasted like Mediterranean style tomatoes. That combination just did not work. I added mixed mushroom for some variety but they added nothing to the dish. Edible. That's it. My friend ordered a medium ribeye. Portion was great but half the meat was so tough and dry that she left it on the plate. When we commented so to the service staff the response was...""well you ordered medium"". As a person who prefers a rare steak, I understand the difference in texture but it still does not mean that a medium steak cannot also be moist and flavourful. This just showed poor quality of meat and cooking techniques. Marmalade Ion is a lovely place to gather and the staff are trying their best, but even with a Triple Plus subscription, I would hesitate to head there anytime soon to have their mains. I hope this is a once off.",neg

Second time there this year. asked for window seats during reservation but that didn't fall through. A heavily perfumed lady sat down next to us and the service staff were discreet in helping us change seats. Menu didn't state that food came with chilli oil which was a big turn off. hope for improvements the next time we return!,pos
"Fantastic food, reasonable price and nice environment",pos
"It's a nice spot at Kovan with a blend of French and Italian foods near the heartlands. I enjoyed the French Onion Soup which although served hot, is my preferred way of savouring the soup slowly instead of lukewarm soup so that I can take in sips and at every moment taste the warmth and flavour of my beloved soup.  Whether Alkove makes the best French Onion Soup or not, it will be the only soup I'll order here.  I also love the bread toast that goes so perfectly with the Seafood Stew though I was toggling between my soup and stew causing the stew to be lukewarm, the flavour of the stew didn't decline.  Seafood was sufficient, not too much nor too little for lunch but would be even better if it was less salty so that the entire flavour of the stew can permeate in the mouth; Spice was perfect.  Alkove is clean, minimalist and lets me relax and totally enjoy my food visually and dining in comfort.",pos
"An excellent meal all round, would recommend this place to anyone",pos
Batter is so light & non greasy it melts in your mouth!,pos
The chocolate marble cake was stale and smelled of beef!,neg
"Food portions overall have shrunk since last year - thats why ""big crissy"" is named "" small crissy"". Ambience is nothing compared to the mandarin gallery. Seating room is so limited and even though i made advance reservations was asked to seat near the entrance. There is no ""door"" to the restaurant ...so it can be eternally warm and uncomfortable for diners. Some of the seating it seemed has been allocated to upstairs - the mezzanine floor where LYF guests can eat at the same floor during breakfast time. Lighting upstairs is dim due to the lower ceiling . Definitely not value for money. Last year was at Mandarin gallery on New Year's Day. This year decided to try out the bugis joint - nothing to shout about. Not worth the price for over-hyped breakfast.",neg
Despite booking ahead and cafe being nearly empty on arriving we were directed to sit at the worst table - right next to the kitchens -noise/heat and distraction of chefs and waiters collecting plates and calling orders etc.  food arrived quickly and was same high quality and service was good.

Had a set dinner and its value for money! Steak was good but wish there's more sauce. Onion soup was good and prefer hot rather than luke warm.

Great service hosted by an Italian lady, gave great recommendations and explained the food they had to offer with much details, although I've to admit I got lost in her accent several times. A pity we didn't get to try much since it was only a party for two and the food is pretty filling. 
I'd recommend the schiaciatta, porchetta and the lovely biscottis available at the bakery, truly a true blue, rare Italian dining experience! 

Downside 
is that the menu had zero pictures so it's difficult to know what to expect, 
local service crew barely knows anything about the food, and almost always had to seek help from the Italians for explanations,
Also the lamb ragout pasta and truffle and mascarpone schacchiata was really rich in flavoring and very much of a one taste dish, so it can be really too much for two to share, would encourage people to bring more friends along and order more food to share!! ;)",pos
"Overall experience was very overwhelming. Several food items were not available on the menu, waiters wasn't very sure on the items on the menu, drinks and food were not served at the same time, main course took more than 30 minutes to be served and was not hot at all.",neg
Boneless chicken was delicious. Wings were OK only. The fries werealso very good. Overall I recommend this meal,pos
"Served steak and dishes in hot sizzling plates which were nice. However the new york strip that we ordered, was mainly fats. When asked whether can use chope voucher in the end of dinner, the staff was unfriendly and said we should let them know upfront that we wanted to use chope voucher. But shouldn't they be the one who remind the diners or ask the diners when they arrive at the restaurant whether they are using chope vouchers? I'm very very disappointed with their service attitude and will not return anymore since there are so many more other friendly staff at other steakhouse in Singapore, which can also serve equivalent, or even better steak than this place. Hopefully they will improve in their service attitude.",neg

Should have been paced. It was like they were in a hurry to turn our table. I would have preferred the sauce to be served on the side, not drenched over the roast cafeteria style.",neutral

Just one important point to make, that is the quality of the coffee. Everything was above expectations until I tasted the coffee. It was very diluted and tasteless. I tried mocha and flat white, I was so shocked by the low quality of the coffee because nowadays good and cheap coffee is easily available. I hope the quality of the coffee can improve because usually coffee is the finale of the whole buffet and I definitely hope we can end with a good experience all the way till the end.",pos
Love their coffee. Today ordered fish and chips which I like it so much üëç,pos
Fantastic authentic Italian experience. We are on Valtenines day and it was a full house yet food was served fast without fuss and with great service. The pork belly is simply excellent. Highly recommended then when you get the bill you think ooh I could really eat here everyday.,pos

"We have been regulars at Symmetry and unfortunately the standard of this place has dropped tremendously. The hash brown was soggy and zucchini fritters burnt. Steak cut was a poor cut and consist of mainly fats. The main issue is the service. Very poor attitude whenever we asked for changes in the menu. Given the number of brunch places in the area, one is better of going to White Label or Penny University. A place that should be avoided.",pos

The porcini ravoli and seafood soup were excellent and tasty

Great BBQ and nice service. The restaurant's ambience is not the best but the food and service more than make up for it. Brisket and Picanha steak were very good. Likely try their bacon and beef cheek at our next visit.,pos

Our food was not good. It was approx 630 sg / 450 usd and probably the worst food I‚Äôve ever had since being in Asia. My salmon and a majority of the food lacked seasoning and honestly color seeing how everything‚Äôs a bit gray or under. The ribs were 79$ and they don‚Äôt even look or taste real. My lobster bisque just smelled and tasted of fishy boiled shrimp and zero pieces of lobster. This was American food? Or Sg‚Äôs rendition of American ? I‚Äôd ask for a refund but it was our last night in sg :),neg

"Honestly do not see the hype about this place. To me, it‚Äôs a very average restaurant. The service was poor - the waiters kept banging into my chair and knocking into me while serving things. One of them even kicked the basket in which they provided to store my bag. The food was nothing to shout about and tasted rather mediocre. The meat served to me wasn‚Äôt very tender, and the sides although they call it their signature wasn‚Äôt very good either. Overall a very normal experience that is definitely not worth the prices they are charging. Dessert was mostly made from Haagen daz ice cream - so why not head there instead? Cheaper and better too!",neutral
"This is for the festive buffet dinner.
Live stations were decent. Thumbs up to the BBQ zone and also the laksa noodles.
However, cooked food free flow stations was disappointing, with prawns and crabs not fresh. 
Cold foods such as sashimi, prawns and lobster were also disappointing. 
Dessert was ok, but log cake was mediocre. Hazelnut chocolate cake was rich and heavenly though. 
Service was good but keep having to ask for replacement of utensils.
Take your money elsewhere for a decent meal for 2 that make costs lesser and taste better.",neg

"Came here for my mum's birthday and was a little apprehensive because 1) I had never been here before and we were here for an important occasion, and 2) there is a lot of hype about Lawry's and I was there with boosted expectations. I'm happy to report that the birthday celebration for my mum was a huge success and a memorable one too, largely due to the high quality of food and service rendered to us at Lawry's. In spite of being seated in a private room, tucked away from the main dining area of the restaurant, we never felt unattended to as the staff were constantly walking in to check on us, to see if we wanted anything, even to adjust the air conditioning as it was initially too cold. Incredibly polite, attentive and charming staff! As for the food, I had very high expectations, but I was not disappointed. All the mains we ordered (filet mignon rare, prime rib dinner and baby back ribs) are highly recommended and I will most definitely be back for more, especially for their baked potatoes. They even have a photo taking service for the birthday girl and printed the photo for her, complete with a neat frame as a keepsake. It's the small thoughtful things like these that make the biggest impression, in my opinion. I have no complaints at all (a marvel for a Singaporean) and I hope that when I'm back at my new favorite restaurant, it will still be this amazing.",pos
Food is fine if you have the Amex discount but I would not have been happy paying full price. Taste is great though freshness/presentation feels like it's an issue at list price. Overall hit the spot with my western food craving,pos

Had dinner here last night Lawry‚Äôs house of prime rib- Singapore. Most often I come here every time I am in SG. The restaurant mgr is mr. Musa. He directed us to a private room instead of a regular table at the dining room. The very big fresh oysters from japan and lobster bisque with whole lobster in your lobster bisque. Ordered the lawry‚Äôs cut medium. French wine was so good. They also amused me every time I eat dinner at lawry‚Äôs prime ribs,pos

"Recently tried the ""Wonder of the Sea"" buffet. Despite being aware of the limited menu options, I was surprised by the extremely slow refill speed of the dishes. It was a seafood buffet night, yet only around 5 lobsters were refilled each time around 15-25minutes. The entire tray being released only during the last serving. Unfortunately, there were no standout aspects of the buffet to mention. Additionally, the desserts table was consistently empty, and when inquired about more desserts, I was informed that none were available. This experience left me feeling disappointed, and I won't be returning as it did not justify the cost.",neg

Duck Confit Risotto has bits of duck in the rice, almost like digging for treasures. It could do better with a large piece. The alcohol and drinks selection is good! And love that the 1-1 happy hour is directly opposite how others do it, full days on weekends!",neg

"The superb service by the attentive servers made up where it lacked in food taste. We ordered a Beef Cappricio (nice), Pepperoni Pizza (thick crust, authentic taste), meatballs (soft and mushy), alio olio (pasta under-cooked and oily) and later added a garlic bread. The food were all served in a jiffy, only had to wait more than double the time for the last order (which i think they forgot), when it finally came, it was hard, looks burnt on the sides and dripping in oil, no taste/hint of garlic on it at all. upon feedback, a 2nd plate was serve, this time with crushed garlic on top of the bread & swimming in a pool of oil. The server who was hovering behind us asked how it was and immediately took it off the bill when we reflected that it is still burnt and hard to eat. The pre-arranged birthday Tiramisu for my girl was well plated and added a nice touch to end the dinner. Friendly & responsive staff deserves many thumbs up!",pos
"Great food and fantastic service! Reasonably priced as well. Restaurant was packed despite it being a Monday, best to make a reservation before heading down.",pos
The burger is small. The appearance is quite different from it shows Inwebsite,pos
"Service was really bad, the steak was probably the saving grace (although there are many comparable or even better ones out there) but I expect more from Lawry's.
1. Only 1 diner had a napkin.
2. Mains was served ahead of the soup and palate cleanser.
3. Yorkshire pie was brought to table by the server and taken away without serving it because she lost her concentration after speaking to another staff.
4. The cutlery provided was mixed and mashed. I don't even know what I was eating with the cutlery.
5. Server failed to remember who ordered which dish, which is a shame for a high-end steakhouse.

Overall, I felt that a mid-end restaurant in US can do a much better job in terms of service.",neg

"Revisited the place again, this time was for a birthday celebration. Place was relatively full 80% excluding private rooms, on a Tues night.
Place had a nice English decor to it, exuding class and grandeur. Food was not exceptional but definitely better than good.
For starters, was served soft and fluffy bread. Had a thick tomato and mushroom soup. Tasted good and flavourful, but nothing beats the Italians for freshness in ingredients. Hokkaido scallops were up next, and it was quite an average dish to me, certainly not worth $40 for 4 pieces.
Next up was the lawrys salad, which was their trademark salad, juicy and fresh ingredients.
Mains were good but not outstanding. We had the lawrys cut which was a huge cut, 280g, juicy and tender. Fillet mignion was rather ordinary. Ribs were soaked with too much sauces. Lobster pasta was acceptable, saved by the freshness of the star of the dish, the lobster tail. But yea who would go to a steakhouse for seafood... had better.
Overall bill came up to $550 for 4 pax.
Verdict= go for the experience or an occasion, as it definitely was a great experience for birthdays. Whole wait staff came out to sing and comes with a complimentary bday cake.
Wouldn't go for a regular meal for the the quality and the price are a mismatch, not saying there isn't quality, but the value is not there. Experience is definitely top notch.",pos

The steak is ok bit I don't quite like the roast beef as its too bloody,neutral
Soggy sandwich and fries that did not appeal to my taste at all.,neg

Always good steak place. Portions are huge. Sides sucked though. Just stick to the complimentary sides,pos
"I used to go to Lawry‚Äôs at The Paragon and I have to say the outlet here looks just as good. I‚Äôm not a roast beef fan so I went for thegrilled ribeye. For the price point that it is at, I would say there are better places to go. For desserts, I opted for the chocolate sundae and mud pie which was great!",neutral
Great place. Lives up to its reputation. Definitely one of the best if not the best worth for value Italian restaurant in Singapore,pos
"I liked that the ambience was quite quiet and chill for a Sunday afternoon.

The staff were attentive, friendly and happy to share food recommendations.

The decor was also very pleasant - I particularly liked the pretty plates!",pos

Amazing visit as always! Bread was soft and nice. Good to go,pos

Brought the family to celebrate the wife‚Äôs birthday. The popular Bedrock Pepper Steak was terribly disappointing. It was not pipping hot (like the countless times we‚Äôve been there) and got cold really quickly (it was barely warm when it arrived). This is not the quality we‚Äôre expecting given we‚Äôve visited so many times before.,neg
"Ribeye has the best flavour among the other cuts - tenderloin and hanger. Dipping sauce wasn‚Äôt enough, when asking for more there is additional $5 surcharge per sauce which is disappointing.",neutral
"Nice little diner tucked away on the mini strip. Water on the tables, good quality food and reasonably priced. Nice Hoegaarden on draft. A little gem.",pos
Friendly staff and amazing food. Always a joy to dine here,pos
"It is sad that they decided to give us a table right outside the toilet when there were so many tables available. We were on time for our booking. End of the day Blackbird is a place to enjoy the live music, not so much for its food which is standard fare. If you are offered a seat in the car park and outside the toilet, defeats the purpose!",neg
The pork belly is a must try. Better to book as it gets quite crowded,pos
"As always I think , iO is the best Italian in Sin. The dishes can lest us enjoy and feel authentic Italy with affordable pricing.
Do recommend to all who love Italian cuisine",pos
Extremely complicated procedure just to use a Chope voucher. Chope should also review it's voucher redemption policy and make it less complicated.,neg
"The staff was very helpful and detail in informing us on the order process that although I use the QR code to scan for menu, I have to order through him, then he would inform the kitchen. If there is anything from the kitchen, the kitchen would inform him before he informed me. I ordered duck confit and peruvian seafood basket totaling S$57.55 with service and tax fees. Although I was asked if we had any allergies like nuts, we were not informed that the peruvian seafood basket is going to be spicy. So it would have been good if we are informed in advance then I would have ordered alternative. The function to be able to pay via QR is good then I dont have to queue at the cashier. Overall embience was a bit noisy although table was spaced out. Would come again for dessert though coz' the mains are on the high side.",neutral
I have a great time at Lawry's. The staff were very attentive and my dinner companion accidentally dropped her napkin. They immediately replaced it with a new one. The filet mignon i ordered was on point as was the truffle rosemary crusted lamb. Overall a great dinner experience!,pos
One of the best steak houses in the city.,pos
We always enjoyed our dinner at the iO Italian Osteria with good food and service.,pos
Smooth rich texture¬†juicy steak,pos
The spicy ones are not as spicy as I expected. Wings and drumlettesare a little on dry side but overall still tasty.,pos

"Excellent food & service! I brought along a cake for my mom's celebration and the staff were very accommodating, helping to set up the cake for the surprise!",pos
"So, so expensive. Overpriced, really.",pos
"A number of dishes that were not available, poor service and a shame that when you indicate your booking is for a special occasion and ask for a table near the window, they don't give you a table at the back. 

All in all, this place looks tired and is desperately needing a refresh.",neg
"Great atmosphere and service! Food was delicious too, especially the stuffed Roman Schiachatta. Perhaps the portion of the pasta could be bigger, but the taste was fantastic!",pos
Great place to chill out üëçüëç,pos
"Portions were really sad. Total $90++ order could probably feed 1person realistically. Completely unacceptable if dining in, no reasonwhy this should be tolerated for delivery",neg
Always enjoy our dinner at iO Italian Osteria at hv2,pos
"One of those restaurants that justifies their expensive food. Great service, great food, great restaurant over-all.",pos
Amazing place!,pos
"Overall Lawry‚Äôs experience is unfortunately underwhelming. Have not been here in quite a while and rating is predicated on:

- service was very rushed like a clock work factory. Somehow all servers were in a rush, even In their speech which made the environment unnecessarily high pace and tense.

-food was understandably pricy for the portions and quality especially the side spinach/corn/peas

-if you love their prime ribs enough to overlook above then this will be your place.",neutral
The Valentine menu date wasn‚Äôt updated properly due to the restaurant miscommunication.,pos

"Great food, always fresh and tasty",pos
The chicken is really good and the quality is pretty consistent,pos
Tender and juicy beef cooked to perfection!  Everything was tasty. Presentation of the food was nice. Greatlt commendable is the attentive and personalised service. I didn't like to sit next to a few couples at one side of the room as it felt strange like in a tuck shop. I rather sit in the main hall Whicj I did last time when we were 3. Suggest you think about how you could sit couples in the main hall.,pos
They don't even allow us to finish our last beer that we already paid. I asked if I can take awat but got rejected. Worst restaurant ever and i will never return.,neg
"The food were good and the service provided by the waitress were good too, although slightly pricey.",pos
"Slow service, from getting seated, to taking orders, to requesting for chili sauce, to getting a refill of water. Waiting 10min after asking 3 different staff is ridiculous. Service staff should be trained to be more attentive to customers. Else no one will wanna be back for mediocre food and poor service, even if you serve fancy drinks",neg
"crust was too soft, flavor of the cheese and sauce wasn‚Äôt great either.only + is the price but even then just pay a bit more and you can get amuch better pizza at eg pepperonis, lino",neg
Expensive but makes up for it in Quality and density.,pos
"The so called famous spin bowl  salad was too salty. The mocktail was too watery and tasteless. The mussels were not fresh and the sauce was too salty too. The beef was dry n not tasty, even with the sauce. Mind you all these come with high prices. Why do so many people giving it 4 and 5 stars? It's misleading! C'mon.",neg

Parking lots not enough,neutral
Fast delivery and food taste as good as when eat at the shop üòã,pos
"Honestly only came here to see why beef here is so expensive. Unfortunately did not find out why. I would not say it was terrible, but if I had paid full price (I got the Citibank Card discount of 40% off), I would have cried myself to sleep.

Had the prime rib dinner, the Lawry's Cut. Nice and beefy. Enough for my appetite. Not sure for smaller eaters. Also ordered the foie gras as a starter. 2 thick slices came, very fatty and delicious.

May not return if I have to pay full price. Even if I do, will definitely skip the prime rib dinner. Service staff were excellent though!",neutral

Peri peri chicken was slightly burnt, some corners of the meat and skin was charred. Bar platter was reasonable, the wings in the platter was more savoury, wasn‚Äôt able to taste any signature recipe in it. Would ask for their signature dishes the next round, otherwise it‚Äôs a good place to dine and relax in the evening, as we watched the owners walking their horses in front of the restaurant.",neutral
needs some sound dampening.  music too loud and conversations from other tables reverberates from the hard ceiling.,neutral

Expensive but tastes good. Ordered two diff types. The pulled beef wasbetter than the chicken.,pos
Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. There was some delay for those who ordered prime rib. Others at the table had almost finished their meal before the rest had been served their mains. They Lawry's cut was a bit of a waste as any meat along the bone was raw and cold. Overall a bit disappointing.,neg
Definitely! It‚Äôs one of my fav place for all day breakfast; awesome place for catch up with friends and the food standard is great,neutral
coleslaw was BAD,pos
Food was okay. Service bit slow. Think understaffed...,neg
The shop was not opened at 12pm. No lights on. I have to wait for 10 to 15 mins for them to open the restaurant. And I have to rush back to work after lunch.,neg

This is the only Italian restaurant I would go for my Italian food craving! Totally authentic in neighbourhood. Not v cheap but quality ingredients used.,pos
The servers were great! Friendly and helpful.,pos
"Great Prime Ribs!  Although its a bit of the expensive side.. its worth it.  Got the Lawry‚Äôs Cut at $145 and OMG its hue and thick!  Juicy, tender and flavourful beef with every bite.  The set comes with their signature spinning salad that is surprisingly really good I wish the serving was a but more (please lol).  REAL mashed potatoes with gravy and the soft yet crunchy yorkshire pudding complements the ribs very very well.  Oh and the jus is super tasty too!  Ambiance is elegant and exudes a feeling of dining in the victorian era.  Service is impeccable from the tossing of the salad to slicing the prime rib right beside your table.  Every single staff is very very attentive and I also love their uniform.  Had the mudpie for dessert and its delicious!  I really want to give Lawry‚Äôs 5 stars but I have to be honest that the price can be a bit more affordable.  I was happy to get a 10% discount with my citibank card though.  Overall I still highly suggest to give Lawry‚Äôs a try as there‚Äôs not a lot of restaurants in SG that serves prime ribs with this quality.",pos
"First time patronize this restaurant, think will be our first and the last. Meat platter sausage was so saltish, grilled fish taco was tasteless, can‚Äôt taste the fish at all. Ribs was too hard and dry. Fries and burger were much better then the meat platter set, don‚Äôt think it worth for the price. Restaurant is old and they blocked a seat under the aircon area, worry there will be a leaking. So through out we worry there will be water coming from the aircon.",neg
"Went on a quiet weekday night. Food was decent but nothing special. But making payment was a horrible experience. The lady manning the pos ignored me for a good amount of time while keying stuff into the pos, not sure why she cannot put that on hold for a moment and just let me settle payment. When she finally have time to handle my payment, she told me she wasn't very sure how to claim the chope vouchers? I mentioned I am using the voucher when I stepped into the cafe, and we dined for about an hour. There was only two other tables beside ours for most part of our time there. Why didn't she ask for help earlier or call someone when she's busy typing stuff in the pos? Oh and the best thing is, halfway while telling me she is unsure how to claim the voucher, she went off to make tea? Nobody was even rushing her to make tea? After making the tea then she called another staff to get help claiming the voucher.",neg

"It was not a cheap Christmas meal but food was quite average and we were seated along the aisle of the restaurant at the back near their kitchen. Besides watching the staff running in and out and having a few kicked my chair several times, it was hard to get their attention to ask for anything even though there were a stream of their staff around. We had a bill of slightly over a thousand for four of us but for this amount, we will probably go somewhere else next year.",neg

We were the only other table! There was only one chef and the waitress tried her best but it was out of her control. There has to be a better system.",neg
The meat in the 2 chicken burgers were rather hard and dry like theyhave been overcooked!,neg

Very personalize and friendly service. Food is good and relaxing atmosphere... very crowded though..,pos

Tasty food with reasonable price. Love the sorbet. It's under the dessert category but it can substitute as a drink as well.,pos
Good taste and qualitative paste but definitely too expensiveconsidering the offer in other restaurants,pos

Disappointed that we were unable to get a seat indoors despite reservation earlier,neg

High scores for coffee. Already feedback about Laksa Fish and Chips. Will be back to try the other food!,neutral
Chicken skin was way too hard and Chicken chop was delicious asusual.,pos
"Generally savoury dishes were small, not flavourful enough. for instance, the masala potatoes had spices that did not permeate through the potatoes. the crabmeat pasta didnt have anything spectacular. mac and cheese was alright. the best was the burger. sticky date pudding was smashing it. the place was a tad warm but lucky they have a air cooler set up after we requested. Service varies between the different servers but generally polite. I would keep this place just for desserts and nth more than that.",neg

Ordered Mac n cheese as the sides and it tasted quite terrible. Steakwas medium rare but was also rather tough still. Chicken chop wasnormal.,neutral
"Love the atmosphere at the restaurant. The coffee is fantastic too. Everyone loved the coffee. Food is a bit pricey, and we didn't like the sausage. They also added sugar into the waffles as it tasted sweet (ok for adults, but I think it's too sweet for children). Would come back here again for the coffee.",pos
food poisoning for 2d after having meal there :(,neg
yum,pos
"It's a mix between tasty food and staff that rush to clear your table. Yes, it's probably the most juicy steak I had but not the best (price paid VS meat grade). Portions are just nice (i had the wagyu- not totally filling). Some of the table staff clear plates without double checking (I timed it and my plates were all cleared exactly 1 hr from entering). The senior staff in all black that takes the photos was very professional and polite, while the other staff actually asked me if I wanted the bill. I've never been to a place where that has happened. Either they give it to you when closing or you ask for it. Felt a bit rushed but overall it's a fairly good experience worth trying once.",neutral

Ordered rosti and it was burnt black.. not sure how can such an easy dish be overcooked till it is black. Perhaps that explains why the place was almost nearly empty for weekend brunch timeslot.,pos

Buzzy place. I liked their flat pizza bread and super huge burrata (not on main menu). Tried some specials from their online menu as well. The pork belly was so so.,pos

food is great. just that they forget my brown sauce for the chicken. itsok tho next time just remember. thanks!,pos

"The service from the staff was terrible. The lady who served us was rather condescending and unhelpful when asked about the dishes or beverages. She gave us one word answers when asked about the dishes and had a rude reply and expression throughout. When asked for a special request that was not served correctly, she was unapologetic and got the manager to speak to us instead. To pay for the bill, we did the QR scan to pay for the bill. When we left they completely ignore us without saying thanks per goodbye like they did with every other customer. Instead, they were busy checking if we have paid for the bill or not, as we could see what they were doing at the table check. It was very unpleasant. Disappointing service and terrible experience, worst service we‚Äôve had at a PS Cafe outlet. We will never return to this outlet ever again. And no one should ever!!! I would not recommend going there!!!!",neg

"Decided to have steak for early Sunday afternoon meal. Most of the other steakhouse options were closed at 4pm and will open at 6pm.

Had the mussels and medium rare rib-eye and cream spinach for sides. Coupled with a glass of Sangiovese house pour.

The steak was served with salad but on spinning bowl salad with thousand island dressing which wasn‚Äôt spectacular (this used to be proper caesar salad a few years back) and seems like ready-to-eat dressing.

Mussels ala pomodoro was good and tomato sauce pair very well.  The mussels itself wasn‚Äôt dehaired, so preparecto remove all the hairs before you eat. The garlic bread served with it, works perfectly with the sauce.

Steak was good with black pepper / mushroom sauce, I didn‚Äôt fancy the other sauce with it.  The layers of fat was enough to give a good flavor in your pallete.

Overall, the place is average and not really special for a steakhouse.  Might be a bit pricey for the average taste.",neutral
"Good food, great service as always. Can be pretty noisy tho. Porchetta and pizza never disappoints.",pos

"Terrible first experience.

I bought a 1-for-1 Mains voucher on Chope for $36 (avg $18 for each main). Once seated, we were given a Lunch Specials menu with Soup + Main + Drink for $18.90, which seemed like a better deal than the Chope offer. Confused, we tried asking the staff, but it was hard to get anyone's attention as they were preoccupied with an event outside. 

Took a while before another waitress came, said we were given the wrong menu, handed us the ala carte menu without explaining the voucher details or the price difference and left swiftly to serve the other tables.

Later, I asked the same waitress if we could top up $0.90 for the soup and drink. She first agreed, then backtracked, saying the voucher only applied to the ala carte menu.

Overall, the experience felt poorly managed due to the focus on the larger group and unclear communication on the voucher. To top it off, both the lobster and pasta of the Chilli Lobster Mafaldine Pasta were overcooked.

Never coming back.",neg
Nice and cosy cafe . Good place for catch up . The food is nice,pos
"had a wonderful dinner experience in the restaurant! from the time we were greeted at the entrance by Maricel to having our order taken by Roy, it was nothing short of magical. everyone on the team worked seamlessly to bring a friendly and inviting atmosphere accentuating the excellent quality and taste of the food served.

Overall the service was excellent and the food was fantastic.",pos
Love their quality of food. Has been keep going back.,pos
"Food was pretty decent, we ordered Scandinavian and preparation definitely took less than 20mins even though they mentioned 20mins preparation time needed. Not a fan of their iced latte, but it‚Äôs personal preference as I like my coffee icy cold but when the coffee cubes melted to give it enough taste, the coffee was very close to room temperature.  

We are a party of 3, ordered different items, and wanted to split the bill. Unfortunately, the waitress that brought us the bill can‚Äôt be bothered to go one step further to split the bill according to what we had. She suggested splitting the bill equally, which don‚Äôt really make sense as each of us had different food and drinks.",neg

As for the food, the wagyu & mash could be better in terms of the amount of mash that served on the plate. it would be better if the weight of the wagyu is stated, same goes for any steak item in the menu. for the mushroom soup, it would be better if there is more mushroom chunks or a garlic bread at the side. as for the tropical island, stickydate cake and smoked duck lemak cili padi was superb as always. overall loved the ambience and service. would rate it an 8/10. thank you for the memorable experience!",pos

The quality dropped significantly. The steak was very hard and sticky date pudding was not dry. Servers were not checking customers at all. Fast food quality for hefty price tag.,neg
"When we arrived, we had doubts on some of the food items. I went to ask the waiters to clarify my doubts, instead of answering me, they walked away. That was very rude of them. Not just 1 but 2/3 of them. It was a very simple question of eg. What is pearl tea? They could not answer. They brought someone else to answer me but that other waiter still couldnt answer me. That is not professional behaviour. It really shows the lack of prior training at least could have familiarise yourself with the menu. When we ordered the food, with high tea, the tea cakes shouldnt be that long to prepare but we waited 30minutes for it. Only after complaint they prepared our food. And THE FOOD WAS COLD. i really expected better.

Not the service was terrible, the food was bad. Dont get me wrong, the food looked appetising but taste wise, IT WAS HORRIBLE. It didnt complement each other. Will i come back again? No. It was such a disappointing mother's day celebration.",neg

"We were so excited to go and get a decent steak.. reviews on here are a little mixed but the place is still pulling in 4.4/5 with over 1000 reviews.. The food quality was diabolical..

I have no idea how they can charge $115++ for a steak that I could get for $10 at my old local pub and still not be 100% happy.

Bread and salad were served first.  Bread was nothing special, no flavour, a simple roll that appeared to be purchased in rather than baked fresh onsite..  salad was made fancy at our table, but unfortunately that was the only wow factor about it..  basic lettuce, a few croutons 3 1/2s of cherry tomatoes and 2 of the tiniest cubes of beetroot.. the dressing was coating everything..  it was served on its own but not enough flavour to standup on its own.. would have been better served with the steak.  I was working my way through my salad and chatting to my wife.. I was only 1/2 way through and the waiter asked if he could clear?  Maybe most people leave the droopy over dressed salad?

I ordered a rare Ribeye..  the steak was probably 1cm or possibly less thick..  it was closer to medium than rare, possibly due to it being so thin.  There was not a drop of blood or even redness, it was just grey inside..  the grill it was cooked on was not hot enough either.  There was light colouring but no charing or caramelisation of the fats.. the outside had that boiled texture where the steak cooked in its own juice because the grill isn‚Äôt hot enough. the quality of the meat was awful.. full of gristle, sinuw and the fat couldn‚Äôt be chewed, no scrumptious melt in your mouth fat.  The veg served with the steak looked like it had been bought in frozen.. dilapidated slices of carrot, a mangy broccoli and mash potato that was dry as.

My wife ordered the prime rib beef English cut, medium rare single slice.. it was bad bad bad..  it tasted like it had been boiled and was very wet, not the consistency it‚Äôd expect from a joint of prime beef.. between us we couldn‚Äôt finish it, it was that bad.  I know the Americans think the  English eat boiled beef and carrots, but if it tastes like that prime rib English cut, i really hope they don‚Äôt.

We ordered the silver trio sides (peas, corn, creamed spinach).  I think the guy had had it on the cart for a week and just kept adding hot water..  no flavour, no seasoning and just bland.. also a very small plate, no idea how they justify $19 for it..

The prime rib came with horseradish.. now I love horseradish, so was looking forward to it.. it came as 2 small dollops in 2 bowls, one creamy one regular.. the creamy one had no horseradish flavour, not really creamy to any extent either.  The regular was just plain weird.. a mix of bitterness with a vinegar flavour and undertones of horseradish.. they were so bad I even tried mixing them together, it made it slightly palatable but was still not right.

Although the meal was awful and probably the worst I have had in Singapore, the view from our window table was nice..  but alas there had to be something that ruined it.. on the table near us was a couple with 2 young children, my guess was 3 & 5.  Neither the parents or the restaurant staff had any issues with them running up and down between the tables, screeching at the top of their voices and chasing each other under tables and over chairs..  it felt like i was in a McDonald‚Äôs playground, if I had been at least I‚Äôd have only spent $10 on a bad meal rather than $300.

My wife‚Äôs comment when they put her plate in front of her hold the most accurate review ‚Äúit looks like my school dinners used to look‚Äù

My advice to anyone thinking of going.. just don‚Äôt.. I feel I‚Äôve taken one for the team, so appreciate and seek a decent steak elsewhere..

I‚Äôm gutted I didn‚Äôt take photos üò¢üò¢",neg
"The weekend brunch kinda disappointing, especially time wasted queuing upon entering & be seated it took us 20min. Followed by a queue of 20min to get the food & pastry at the service counter. Total dining time from your reservation is 90min! We have not sufficient time to even finish our food. Mains rather disappointing as well. Small portion and not up to cafe standards. Will not visit the brunch again! Coffee is not included in the brunch buffet",neg

"Definitely on the finer side of life. The main course comes with salad and Yorkshire pudding (served with main course). Servers were very attentive and friendly. Ordered the California cut of beef, and was surprised to see that the sauce which came with it is quite watery. The beef is tender but several portions of it was quite tough in my opinion (ordered medium rare). However, my family members said that their cut of beef was very tender so I guess it really depends on which cut is served to you. They also gave us a birthday cake and took our photo! Gave us a copy too. Overall was quite a pleasant experience.",pos
Very surprised the restaurant staffs prepared birthday cake for my husband today. I just briefly stated was my husband BD on 9/8 on my reservation.  Thank you so much for such a meaningful thought .,neutral
"2-course Value meal is very worth it in terms of price . However, overall portion of food is small. Only (additional) sharing items were Truffle fries or Bread board, while I was hoping to add some protein dishes (such as wings or other meat dishes) to add on since the main course was lack of it. Would be good if more savoury items could be added to menu",neg
"Came here for lunch on the day of the US presidential elections and have to attest to the fact that there's nothing better than excellent Italian food, drink and service as balm for the soul. We had the pork belly, burrata and special of the day - the duck ragu taglietelle, which were divine. We had the pistachio tiramisu for dessert and couldn't be more pleased.",pos
the waitress who took care of our table was very nice,pos
"The prime rib is excellent, tender and juicy and you can get the cut that you like off the cart.  Being used to the normal slab when you order prime rib in the US,  the thin slices (English or California cut) that Lawry's serves will surely disappoint for the price.  Enjoyed the salad, which is fresh and nicely chilled.  Service is top notch.",pos
"Assorted Pizzas did not come in the small serving as listed on the menu, had to order the medium ones which were ok but were too much for the 2 of us considering we ordered another pasta and some starters as we weren't sure of the size. Cosy place for a Saturday lunch as it wasn't too crowded.",pos
Favorite place to have prime rib here.,pos
Nice nachos n caesar salad. Steak benedict was a nice thought but the steak quality was not good considering it was $29.  Fed back to restaurant manager. Took action to mitigate.,neutral
Food arrived hot and crispy! Chicken is juicy!,pos
Just gotta love it!,pos
"Highly recommended for birthdays!

FOOD:
- delicious!
- recommend the lawry's cut - it's what they're known for, and you definitely won't leave hungry
- the lamb on the other hand was a pretty small portion comparatively - likely won't order it again

SERVICE AND AMBIENCE:
- service was good and attentive. Great job!
- nice decor, casual music (not complaining) so slightly more casual than other restaurants of this price tier - I don't mind it actually

Will be back!",pos

"The burger bun was dry and cracked. When I brought it to the attention of the waiter, he said he would replace only the bun! Not sure how he expected me to eat that.

"Satisfying meal, service could be more prompt, check was wrongly tabulated, so check your nill carefully.",pos
Smallest serving of crispy fried chicken with pancakes. Cost is $29 but McDonald‚Äôs give more fried chicken on their mcspicy. Delayed service of our drinks we had to ask twice to get our drinks served which they‚Äôd forgotten to prepare. I won‚Äôt be back again.,neg

Service is attentive but there were only 2 table of customers. Indoor seating capacity is very limited (to my surprise) and there was an annoying fly keep flying around us while we were chatting which was irritating.

Nice cafe in the Kovan/ Simon Road area. Clean and bright and the food is good. Good and friendly service too and the kids enjoyed their meal.,pos
Very friendly service,neutral
"Let's start with the positives, there were indeed a few silver linings. They evidently use quality meats, and the service was top-notch.

Next comes the monologue of negatives. The bread rolls looked and tasted cheap, like something from a 7-11 rather than homemade. The classic salad that they state is some kind of institution for them is odd with the waitress doing some kind of dance whilst pouring the dressing which tasted like some 1970s starter with sweet thousand island dressing over sad looking wet salad.

We ordered the classic prime rib for mains which came with wet and bland mashed potato, cold sloppy creamed spinach, and peas that were so overcooked they turned white with texture like bullets. The Yorkshire pudding wasn‚Äôt all that bad.

We ordered the beef medium rare but it was served blue. All in all, around 200SGD per person excluding the wine for some of the most embarrassing food we‚Äôve experienced in a while.

The food certainly doesn‚Äôt live up to the standards the restaurant tries to portray. The stars are for service as the food is shocking!

The chefs have the audacity to wear large medals around their necks suggesting at some point in the distant past the establishment was a hit. In 2024 we have to assume they were awarded for bowling because they certainly can‚Äôt be for cooking!",neg
"Excellent food quality and selection.
Service staffs friendly and attentive, water topped up regularly and soiled plates cleared promptly.",neutral
Fantastic! Delicious food. My favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. Must visit.,pos
Best pizza in town and very quick service. A treat.,pos

"Ordered the seafood pasta, pull lamb burger and french toast. Only the seafood pasta is great. Pull lamb burger has a dried pulled lamb and french toast is look greater than it taste.

They seemed to forget my order for our pulled lamb burger and there was an akward wait for the food.

U can try once here not necessary to return again.",neg
Nice and friendly staff. Ambience is amazing and the food is great! Big portion as well.,pos

Ordered rodeo wings. All drumlets except 1 wing. Price increase andconsistency drop. Disappointing,neg
"We ordered the Wagyu onglet, the onglet had a strong scent of solid fuel which overpowered the natural flavours of the steak. The waitress is proactive in making recommendations and is able to advise the cut of meat to order based on my preference of fattiness, done-ness and flavour.
Somethings interesting we noticed are:
‚Ä¢ though we are seated at the bar right in front of the one playing our food, the waiter was asked to provide service by walking one round to serve the food to us on the other side of the bar.
‚Ä¢ the chef cooking the steak kept pressing on the meat over the binchotan, which will release the oil and juices from the steak, thus causing the final product to be lacking in flavour. He also kept using a small knife to cut the steak to check the done-ness. Which makes us conclude that‚Äôs probably the reason why they serve their steak cut into smaller slices. Disappointing steak for the price paid.",neg

Portions particularly the sides seem to have shrunk a little but things like creamed spinach and corn are still consistent. Had the Lawry‚Äôs Cut and it was  tender and juicy with a good roast flavour albeit perhaps a little under seasoned on this occasion.

"I had the opportunity to visit Lawry's in October 2019, and I must say that my experience was somewhat disappointing. Comparing it to my previous visit in 2015, there were noticeable differences that left me underwhelmed.

One aspect that stood out was the decline in the food quality. The dishes I had during this visit did not live up to the high standards I had experienced before. It was disheartening to see that the food did not match my expectations and previous positive experiences at Lawry's.

Another issue I encountered was the inconsistency in staff attentiveness. While some members of the staff provided excellent service and paid attention to our table, others seemed disinterested or neglectful. This inconsistency can greatly impact the overall dining experience, as it leaves customers feeling less valued and attended to.

Furthermore, I noticed that the manager seemed to selectively check on tables to inquire about the food and overall satisfaction. This approach can create an impression that only certain tables receive special attention, while others are overlooked. It would be ideal for the management to ensure that all tables receive equal attention and care.

Lastly, I want to mention the change in the birthday celebration service. During my previous visits, Lawry's used to take photos of guests celebrating their birthdays and provide digital copies of the pictures. However, in October 2019, it was disappointing to learn that they no longer offered digital copies.This change took away the convenience and personalized touch that I had appreciated in the past.

Based on my experience in October 2019, I must admit that I was left feeling disappointed. The decline in food quality, inconsistent staff attentiveness, and changes in the birthday photo service were factors that impacted my overall experience at Lawry's. I hope that the restaurant has addressed these concerns since then and has worked towards improving the overall dining experience for its patrons.",neg

Customer service was on point - shoutout to Shawn for being a superstar! The food? Just as fabulous as I remembered from other branches, especially the Pan-Seared NZ Akaroa Salmon, which danced on my taste buds like a culinary ballet. Little Farms truly shines with its fresh, wholesome ingredients. This experience restored my faith in the Valley Point branch - definitely a win for families and foodies alike. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!",pos
"Lawry's Prime Ribs is an exceptional restaurant with friendly and knowledgeable staff. The live cooking experience is a highlight, as the chef cooks the prime rib in front of you on a cart, adding to the excitement of the meal. The prime rib itself is cooked to perfection and served with delicious sides like mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. But what really impressed me was the Yorkshire pudding - it was light, fluffy, and had a golden-brown crust that was simply divine. The restaurant has an elegant and classic atmosphere that's perfect for a special occasion or romantic dinner. While it can be a bit pricey, the quality of the food and service is definitely worth it. Highly recommended, especially for the live cooking experience and amazing Yorkshire pudding!",pos

I'm not a fan of roast and made the mistake of ordering that instead of a steak. The spinning bowl of salad performance is as usual, a fun watch for the kid. Yorkshire is great, ribs are chewy and abit dry. Lamb is great. The service is very attentive and heartfelt - 5 stars.

Overall, a great place to host a celebration for an elder or children because the opulence of the restaurant takes u away into another cultural space while u r there.",neutral

"Good service and nice atmosphere for chill, casual dinner!",pos
"Ambiente is nice but standards have dropped quite a bit.
For my taste it's a good bit too chilly, aircon needs to be turned down a bit.
Spinning salad came very cold and was obviously prepared ahead of time and stored in the fridge.
Yorkshire pudding didn't taste fresh and was cold.
My wife's steak (diamond cut) looked nice but turned out to be rather fatty. My cut (Lawry's cut) was the same. The meat quality definitely was better before. Never had we so much fat at the end.
The waitress cleared the table next to ours and threw the new tablecloth on, swiping almost over our table. You could feel the breeze of the tablecloth. When clearing our table, the waitress just grabbed everything and rushed off, like she's in a rush to go somewhere. Someone bounced off the wooden wall where we were sitting!

And lastly the plate where the birthday cake was served was dirty and needs a decent scrubbing before the next piece of birthday cake gets put on it and served to the next birthday person!

Never have I experienced such behavior in a restaurant like this.

Main waitor was excellent, therefore the 2 stars.

Considering that we used to come here every year for many years, this will be our last visit. Especially as this was my wife's birthday dinner.

Sad but lot's of restaurants have become like this.",neg

Very satisfied with the food and service. One of the best Itailian restaurants in Singapore. It was worth the drive.,pos
Efficient service with a smile. The laksa was tasty as always - so consistent. For your hospitality!,pos
"Service: decent. They took out orders, served food, cleared plates but otherwise left us alone.

Salad: kind of crisp and crunchy lettuce, curry tomatoes were fine, croutons were crispy. The dressing was unremarkable, and they used iceberg. I have nothing against iceberg but at that price point, they could've afforded to go for something with more pizzaz The dressing tasted like it came out of a squeeze bottle.

Mashed potatoes: lumpy, not v buttery, and not much of it. Flavor was deeply unexceptional.

Yorkshire pudding: okay.

Prime rib: very tender and juicy with a pretty salty gravy to stand up all that meatiness. I also enjoyed the meltingly tender seams of fat running through the meat. Might not be everyone's cup of tea.

Ribeye steak: I'd say the steak was no more than 1 - 1.5 cm thick, which is pretty thin for $115. I ordered it medium rare but it wasn't particularly juicy (probably because it was so thin). Seasoning was barely discernable, and I couldn't taste much sear on it. It came with seasonal vegetables which translated into 1 sauteed shiitake mushroom, 1 pickled carrot slice (yes. SLICE), and 2 steamed broccoli florets

All in all, if you can get your hands on good beef and you have a meat thermometer, you can do this yourself. And make better sides for a fraction of the price.",pos

I enjoyed the Lobster Bisque and ‚ÄòPanggang‚Äô Pork Belly. However, the Beef Bourguignon was way too spicy to have a whole bowl of, even for a person with a pretty good spice tolerance. The garlic mash was tasty and portion was substantial. The Cempedak Key Lime Tart was not good as there were no key limes besides the decorative dehydrated lime slice on the top. Perhaps they could update the recipe to add a cempedak and key lime curd instead of just the cempedak curd. 

Service was quite good but I had to wait for my dessert for quite a long time after finishing my main course.",neg
One of the best ribs i've ever eaten to be honest.. the meat literally melts in your mouth.. very very delicious..,pos
"Great variety of dishes from different styles of cuisine. Fresh assortment of seafood. Other dishes such as the dim sum and turkey were a hit or miss. Other than the salted egg bao, the har kow and shumai fell a little short of expections as they were mediocre at best. Turkey was a little bit tough to bite off. Desserts do not disappoint; visually appealing and interesting flavours. 

My verdict: Excellent service and overall decent choice of food, but if you are not a big eater like me, you might feel too full halfway. However, it is still a great once-in-a-while experience, considering the quality and variety of dishes.",neutral

Wondorous experience. Great service. Amazing food.

Prime rib was just fantastic. Tender and juicy. Ordered the Lawry's cut which was at 285g. Enjoyed the big slab of meat entirely.
The tenderloin is lovely as well. We had an extra truffle fries as sides but it was slightly too much because there was alot of carbs going around. Prime rib came with mashed potatoes and a yorkshire pudding. Tenderloin came with mushrooms, salad and mashed potatoes.

There is a 50% discount on the cheaper second main ordered. Restaurant serves up a small slice of cake for those celebrating their birthday.

"The beef enoki was good as the beef was tender. Slices of beef were wrapped around a small bunch of enoki mushrooms. It is a novel idea and pretty good effort by the chefs to come out with this combination. Tender, tasty and satisfying. The only complaint is that the boiled potatoes were not hot enough. However, the dessert of ice cream and brownie added a finishing touch to a fulfilling meal. Overall, the set lunch was good. üëç",pos

Lobster roll and smashed burgers were juicy and yummy. The service could be more attentive. We stood at the entrance for quite a while, with many wait staff walking past but did not even turn to look at us. Waited too long to be greeted and asked for our reservation. Same for ordering. The restaurant is in a circular format and parts of the circle are not seen and heard by the wait staff so we are quite ignored. Water also not refilled in a timely manner during the meal. But I‚Äôll consider returning cos the food is nice.",neutral

"Amazing setting and great food experience spoilt by (extremely) lousy service :((
When the staff greets you with no smiles, gets your orders pretty late, forgets to get sugar with coffee (and does not get it even after several reminders) and then forgets to log in your dessert order and...wait for it...asks you to leave as your 1.5 hours is going to end soon, it's a bad bad experience!",neg

"Our recent visit to Malayan Settlement was truly unforgettable! From the moment we arrived, the service was exceptional. The staff were incredibly friendly, attentive, and made us feel right at home. They ensured everything was perfect throughout the meal, making the entire experience so enjoyable.

The food was absolutely delicious, each dish was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. You can taste the quality in every bite! The desserts were equally amazing, but what truly touched us was the complimentary desserts they brought out for our birthday celebration. It was such a kind and thoughtful gesture that made the evening extra special.

If you‚Äôre looking for a place with outstanding service, a warm atmosphere, and food that will leave you wanting more, Malayan Settlement is a must-visit. Highly recommended!",pos

Lost my booking to start. Put us on a shared table with ripped seats. Food was average at best. Filling in the donut was off. Tater tots were so dry and overcooked when you put a fork in them they exploded to crumb. When asking for ketchup it took so long my food was cold. Service was painfully slow.

"An old school classic steakhouse. The power set lunch is quite worth it. Spinning bowl salad was average but showy, it doesn't have enough egg to complete it.

Cream spinach will is good too. Service was excellent as usual.",pos

Decent eating place in the heartland. Service staff lack the hospitable attitude that makes customers feel welcomed though.,neutral
"To be honest, the only possible reason I would return to this place is for the exemplary service of the staff - mainly Chin, Joon + Keith, and special mention to Salma for affording warmth, patience and professionalism.

Sadly, the food left much to be desired as my only highlight was the well-conceived prawn bisque sauce. The scallops weren‚Äôt seared enough unfortunately. 

And as for the Kimchi steak fried rice, there wasn‚Äôt enough Kimchi intensity; steak was sinewy and lacked tenderness while the portion of fried rice was underwhelming.

What was sadder was the fact that the complimentary Cranberry Lychee cupcake felt lackadaisical for its artificial-tasting buttercream and not-dense-enough cupcake crumb.

May consider returning only for the highly-raved brunch but again, I will ponder on that decision.",neg

"I had the weekday power lunch at the restaurant today

I was welcomed at the reception , however the service staff whom showed me to my table was impatient to my questions when I was asking about card promotions and she divert me to my server when I have more questions , her attitude I find quite arrogant and unpleasant

I have been to top hotels like sun moon lake hotel Taiwan before ,  they will kneel beside you to take your details so you don‚Äôt need to look up

I don‚Äôt feel much service except for one of Staff

There is a uncle whom keep coming to top up our drinks with a smile

The ice spin salad is tasteless and disappointing, it‚Äôs cold fork and cold bowl but the greens are not fresh, they are yellowish, so what‚Äôs the point of all the ice ?

The main is pretty good I must say , the fat of the usda beef resembles a stewed beef but with great fats that competes with the otoro or tuna belly , great Unami

The side dishes are pretty good and creamy

The dessert your waitress never tell me what is it when served , I think it‚Äôs a lychee cake with strawberry pur√©e was dry and very normal

Just eat beef here the rest very very average

However, I'm not too happy with the service, this round.
First, the food that's not in the menu is usually more pricey, that is a known fact for this Resturant 
The staff will try to push for it. Usual experience 

They tried to clear the plates so quickly that a couple of times  when there's still food on my friends' plate, the staff asked if they could clear it. This is very impolite. 

After they come around to check if we would need any more food as it was time for their last order, we mentioned that we didn't need any other order. Then one of the staffs stood very near our table for quite a while

"Ordered garlic mushrooms, pork knuckle and seafood pizza. The only dish likeable is the garlic mushrooms. Pork knuckle meat was dry and tasted like re-heated meat. Only the skin is crispy so it was nice. Pizza dough texture felt more like biscuits as it was overcooked.",neg

"Lawry's is the epitome of old school.  From the colossal table-side serving carts to the waitress' uniforms, there is nothing at all modern about the experience.  Luckily for Lawry's , they pull it off where others don't.  How?  The decor, while dated, is clean and presentable.  The waitresses look like they belong in a 1950s TV show, but the service is friendly and impeccable.  So this is a case where old school is retro and kind of fun.  The food is decent, not as spectacular as the prices suggest they should be, but decent.  The spinning salad is a trademark and is excellent.  The Yorkshire puddings were just barely average... they definitely needed seasoning. If you are looking for a slab of beef in a throwback setting, and money is not a problem, this is the place for you.",pos

"We ordered 2 set lunches with appetisers. The food was great and came with amuse bouche that came along with the set meals, which was delightful. Personally, I would have preferred balsamic vinegar in the olive oil dip for the sourdough bread rather than the b.v glaze (which was sweeter than tart). Overall, the food was good and I would go back again.",neutral
Love it. The meat is so juicy and delicious. Spinning salad is a legend. Must visit,pos
one of my favourite italian places!! they do such a good pork belly and their pizza never disappoints,pos
Fabulous and intimate. Lovely ambience and delightful service. Perfect for small group get-togethers.,pos

"Not recommended!
Poor food for big money.",neg
"It used to be one of my fav Italian place since I stay around the area. However, it seemed that their service and food quality has dropped significantly since COVID. The pistachio tiramisu that I used to love is also no longer distinct in taste. It‚Äôs quite disappointing. Probably wouldn‚Äôt go back again.",neg
"i had an amazing dining experience at wildhoney ! From the moment we walked in, the staff (Mr Danish D)was incredibly welcoming and attentive.

I never got my drink :(,pos
"Please look into your cashier system.
I was charged in full for 2 burgers which I already paid when I purchased the 1 for 1 voucher for steak burger.
The overcharge was for $70+.
Your staff told me though I had bought the shopper voucher, I still had to pay the related service charges & GST.
But your system charged me the full amount ($29.95 x 2 + 10% service charge + GST)
It is simply ridiculous. Luckily I felt something was wrong n went through the bill item by item.
But wasted at least 30 min haggling about it at the counter which was a horrible experience.",neg
"Except a grain of rice was stuck on the new fork-it means dirty-and a male staff changed it without any apology, I had a good time there.",neutral
Steak was nothing to shout about. I do appreciate the showy concept of making the Caesar salad and the chef wearing medals(?) walking around to cut the steak.,neutral

Hearty fare.  Every dish we had was tasty ! Service was also fun and light hearted.  Found some pastas to be a bit heavy - best you clarify if the pasta type is not familiar.,pos
"Let your inner carnivore out! I had the Lawry's Cut medium rare while the lady had the Californian. As u can see it was massive! Served with their special sauce and horseradishes, its a wet-juicy-tasty event! Woohoo! Meat was tender and fresh, leaning a little to the salty side. Different experience from the chargrilled steaks. Also had the foie gras which had a good raisin kinda sauce. AMEX love dining has a great discount here but only applies to the alacarte menu for food...wine is not included which made me cry at the table for a while. More worth it to buy a bottle than per glass FYI.",pos
"Lasagna was a bit too flavourful for my likings. Ceasar salad was valuebuy, big portion . Calamari was a bit charred.",pos
Delivery and Food is good.,pos
Generally is nice but I dun think is worth the value for the cuts.,pos
"Great view, nice food and drinks, lovely service from every staff, especially the one who gave us a band-aid because my friend cut her finger with her phone cover, and also the Filipina staff.  Thank you!",pos
"It is a high-class environment, evoking an upscale atmosphere. While the setting exuded elegance, there's room for improvement in the service department. We did find ourselves waiting a considerable amount of time to place our order.

The restaurant offers a unique amenity: photo-taking services with free prints. However, we encountered a slight hiccup when our photo wasn't promptly printed. A bit of a delay ensued before we finally received our printed photo.

Opting for the anniversary 4-course meal set, which comprised a starter, appetizer, main, dessert, and beverage, we were treated to a mix of flavors. The standout was undoubtedly the signature prime rib, a delectable dish that is an absolute must-try. On the other hand, the braised beef rib fell slightly short of expectations, with the sauce impressing more than the somewhat dry meat.

We indulged in the chocolate cake and strawberry trifle for dessert. While the chocolate cake delighted our taste buds, the strawberry flavor of the trifle didn't quite resonate with our preferences.

Adding to the thoughtful experience, complimentary drinking water was a nice touch, as was the complimentary cake for those celebrating birthdays.",pos
It was a great dinner with great food and ambience.,pos

We had tea time snacks. But was surprised the cookie we ordered was really small. Croissant was ok. But the Apple Crostata was good.,neutral

"Great customer service from Mr Shiva and Lisa, that made up for the disappointing wagyu striploin we had this visit. I ordered a medium cut, but it came very well done and there seems to be an exceptional issue with this batch of beef. Mr Shiva replaced with the classic prime ribs which tasted great as usual. The Lawry‚Äôs team ensured that our dining experience was not affected. We had a great time and will definitely come back again!",pos
"Lovely atmosphere, delicious food, generous portions, friendly staff!",pos
Service was prompt and ambience was fantastic. Was deeply impressed with the attentiveness of the wait staff when they saw that steak was dry and suggested to get more sauce. The wine recommendation also paired well with what we ordered! Thank you Tati for serving us!,pos
"Mushroom soup tasted weird, could improve on the recipe. The rest of the food we ordered were good.",pos
Awesome,pos
iO Italien Osteria serves nice food and reservations is recommended as there is always a queue.,pos
"Ordered the signature Lawry's cut prime rib as well as a filet mignon. Both tasted good, although a little overdone as we ordered medium. Great atmosphere and service.",pos
"Had the Miso Cod Fish ($68++) and The California Cut 160grams ($79++) with the Idaho Baked Potato ($15++).

The steak was really tender and juicy and comes with the Yorkshire Pudding and crispy salad! The 160grams portion was just right.

Miso Cod was sweet and fresh!

Made reservations through Chope and received SMS confirmation from their staff.

As we celebrated my husband's birthday, we were presented a complimentary slice of chocolate cake with two of their waitresses singing the birthday song. They took a photo for us and presented a copy to us at the end of our meal!

Cosy ambience with great service!

50% off the mains when we paid with Amex Platinum card!",pos
"Great food.  For vegetarians, the truffle pasta was recommended (not in menu). It was incredibly tasty. My only gripe is that it cost $32, which is significantly more than the most expensive pasta on menu. Had a bit of a shock when we were paying as they did not inform us of the cost beforehand.",pos
"All the staff that night were really kind, patient, and understanding as we had a surprise birthday celebration at the restaurant. Facilities were kid-friendly as well! Thank you for the great experience.",pos

"Firstly, I did not like that my seat was in the corner when I had requested a water view during reservations I had made one month ago. I also noticed being in the corner meant that it was harder for us to get attention from wait staff eg. Water refill.

"We had a great night of pairing, sake and the Lawry‚Äôs signature roasted USDA Prime Rub of Beef, the famous original spinning bowl salad, appetizers and desserts. It was a surprisingly refreshing combination and the pairings are matched made in Mandarin Gallery, level four.

Both atomi and Lawry‚Äôs are long time neighbors since 2009 and we are glad to co-host this lovely event. This is not the first time we collaborate and certainly more to come in the coming festive seasons.",pos
Service was good and prompt.  Special dish seaweed linguine with scallops and bottarga really shine. Farmhouse chicken is might be a bit spicy for some people so should highlight that.,pos
Good food but comes with a price too for a location at Hillview. Restaurant is very cramp and gets a little noisy as the seatings are very close to one another,pos
Absolutely love the food and ambience. Family friendly . Feels very authentic food . Staff and well versed and friendly too. Complete experience . Will definitely make it our weekend treat.,pos
"Ribs were delicious and so was roast beef. Generous portions.However , the portions of the famous spinning bowl salad seem to be smaller than previous years. Service was good , until the end .I asked a server for my bill and she told me to wait. It ruined the favourable impression of the restaurant's service. If she was busy, she should have referred me to another server. That was the only snag in an otherwise enjoyable experience.",pos
"After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give this restaurant a try for Christmas Eve dinner. O my. All the seafood were not fresh and carried a heavy fishy taste. The oyster was so pungent when arrived, but my wife ate it, wondering why such fishy taste. I didn't know about oysters so we proceeded with the dinner. The lobster in the linguine same fishy taste. I had the lobster last and the plate nearly finished so blame on my luck. The salmon confit was for my kid and we asked the waitress to remove the dish after a couple of small bite. Just pure seawater taste, nothing else. Super terrible meal, spoilt my Christmas Eve this year. Paid $160 for 3. If ever any of my family gets food poisoning tomorrow, the culprit is clear.",neg
Very pleasantly surprised by this order. Definitely one of the bettertakeaway pizzas I've had in a while,pos
Very high noise level and waiting time for the food was a bit long but everything else was good. Service was good too. Service crew take time to chat and recommend items :),pos

Excellent service and food,pos

Been coming to Lawry's for decades. Never disappoints!,pos
"Came on the 15th of June at 6PM walked in for 1pax. Have been a big fan of Lawry‚Äôs and tried locations all around the world. Singapore‚Äôs by far was the most disappointing. The service as well as considerations for food safety was absolutely despicable.

Food Safety

1. The butter for the bread has been piped out onto the plate before guests even arrive, sitting out in the open for god knows how long. Especially in Singapores weather, it is just a matter of time before someone gets seriously ill.

2. I ordered the Califorina cut and was given the end piece that was probably from lunch service. One side was obviously dried and the meat had bloomed. The chef carving flipped the cut over to hide the bloomed side. I understand there are considerations for food wastage, but for a brand like lawrys priding itself on table side service, it is really disappointing. At least slice of the dried out layer, and not serve it to customers right in front of them (I was the first customer to order prime rib for that evening service).

Service:
Everyone knows Lawrys for their table side tossed salad. I was dining alone and the waitress had the nerve to serve me the salad prepared for the table sitting right behind me‚Ä¶I wouldn‚Äôt even expect this level of corner cutting from a cheap eatery, let alone Lawry‚Äôs.

The Yorkshire pudding was ok though.",neg
"I always love the Vivocity brunch. The ambience was good, food was excellent, staff were friendly. Have a really good meal w my friend.",pos
First visit to Lawry's to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Wasn't disappointed with the steak and roast beef...Wine was great also...Service staff was top notch...Kudos!!!,pos
It was a bustling place and the street food options and special menu items were great,pos
"The $25 dinner menu outside the cafe, was advertised as including the Angus beef brisket. But the actual menu in the restaurant does not include it. We were told the menu has changed. If so - will the management please delete the excluded item inside - we went into the cafe because we wanted to eat the beef brisket in the set menu. 

Apart from that, staff were friendly, atmosphere was nice on a Friday evening, and food was great!",pos
Lunch set was affordable and food tasted good. Would return to try other items on the menu!,pos
"Nice restaurant with casual dining space. The burger patty was too firm and just too much sauce on the burger. It was breaking and falling apart, that‚Äôs not how burgers are meant to be eaten. Milk shake was excellent",neutral
Second time here but whoa. Amazing vibes and the food never fail to surprise me,pos
Best beer in Singapore,pos
"The food was delicious and I couldn't help but feel sorry that we were the only customers there. Please support local halal cafes that serve such good quality food. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the steaks, while could be more tender, were still tasty with the sauces. Fries are to die for!",pos
Very convenient location and the food is overall great! Service personnel are helpful and friendly,pos
"Awesome Roast Beef but service was not great.

Medium rare done perfect and you will never go wrong ordering their signature ‚Ä¶",pos

"The meat was very tender, with the English Cut being my favourite. Not much sauce or seasoning needed for a cut that‚Äôs naturally flavourful. The ribeye and fillet mignon were also tender, but not as flavourful.

What we ordered: English cut, ribeye, filet mignon, tiramisu, strawberry English trifle & creme br√ªl√©e.",neutral
"Spent our anniversary at Lawry's using amex love dining. First time in a long while, and as remembered, service and food was excellent. We started with foie gras which was above average. True star was the salad and mains. For mains, I had the Lawry's cut with side of creamed spinach while wifey had wagyu striploin. Both were amazingly good. Note, portions are quite big (including salad and bread and appetizer).

Service was attentive but not overbearing. Would definitely go again.

Each person could select one main from menu and then the brunch buffet selection. Food was mediocre pretty cheap breakfast food, such as scrambled eggs, hash and mash, tatter tots, bacon. Chocolate desserts were nice. For this price, plenty of other better buffet selections with much higher quality food available.

"Don‚Äôt be too adventurous at a prime rib specialty restaurant and the experience should be consistent. Spinning salad, Yorkshire pudding, creamy spinach, a Lawry‚Äôs cut, and the brownie were all superbly prepared and served.

Only issue is the tenderloin which is too dry. Love their prime steak which is carved for us directly, and love the lobster tail. Salad that comes with each beef dish is magnificently tossed! The pudding is great too

Service was good. But I ordered a ribeye medium rare and it was unevenly cooked. Not what I expected for a top steakhouse. Prob they only specialise in prime ribs and not so gd in other steaks.,neg

The restaurant is unexpectedly noisy, especially at this level of restaurant, the atmosphere is considered as bad.

The service is good, and up to level.",pos

Not forgetting Zul, Lucas and the ladies( didn‚Äôt get to see their name) who had attended to our table with impeccable attentions. The staffs were excellent!

Side of chicken breast arrived like a small nugget . Definitely not the regular portion.

Now they even reduce the avocado portions to a few small cubes .

Hmmm",neutral
Very bad taste of this salted egg chicken,neg
The salad was extremely small. It is definitely not worth the pricecharged!,neg
Good ambience with lovely staffs and this remain the same standard for years. Likewise the same goes for their food options and taste too! Always back for the aqme,pos
"Didn‚Äôt even manage to actually eat anything because after 25 mins, we were told that the food would take another 20 mins. (We didn‚Äôt even get water). 

This didn‚Äôt work as we were there with our toddler - who had a specific nap time that we would miss if we continued waiting for our food. So we left. 

They were clearly unprepared for the holiday crowd despite reservations. It was a mess. 

Lastly please don‚Äôt advertise huge grounds for kids to play when the area is only open for members. The reason why we booked a spot here was because of that - but we were only presented with a tiny area opened for kids 5 and above to climb and play around. 

If only they could return our time back to us.",neg

One Service crew was however a letdown in some area. Am however pleased they did call to confirm if to keep reservations when we were 5 min late or so. This was a good job done. 

The crew had no idea how to process Chope vouchers and took more than 10-15 min fiddling and trying to fix. Mixed up 1 drink order which was recommended as preferred drink was not available but we did NOT confirm wanting to drink but it was served.",neutral

So good! It came crispy and hot!,pos
"We order lawry‚Äôs cut and waygu stirploin both in rare. Waugh‚Äôs plate comes in cold without warming up in the kitchen. With the air conditioning, food quickly turned cold even though flavor was pretty good.

We also waited our main courses for almost 20 minutes after finishing salad.

For me these two points are very crucial to define a restaurant. Even though steak was delicious, price was too high for this kind of services.

Also bread was just those buns like in the airplane. That made me quite surprised too.

I would say my steak experience at Morton‚Äôs was way better.",neg

Food there was pretty good, price a bit on the higher side but still not that bad. Initially I went there to try the scones. It was soft and fluffy but too crumbly for my liking and not sweet enough, tasted more salty than sweet so suitable for those who prefer salty than sweet stuffs. Overall, it has been a very nice experience there. Will go again to drink afternoon tea with friends :)",pos

Great food and impeccable service. The servers and the restaurant made many accommodations to our needs out of their own initiative.  The dining experience was extremely enjoyable throughout! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,pos
Service was really excellent throughout the night. Wine was really really acidic but I think it was the wine that we chose. What wasn‚Äôt good was the Bar Cicheti popup - in particular the Squid Ink Taglioni that was way too salty (coming from a person who loves salty food) we sent it back and they remade it in a much smaller portion (weird) but was still equally salty.,neg

Good varieties on the menu. Food is as expected and service a bit slow for weekday lunch even though there are many staff standing around.,neg
"Probably would be more suited for someone which knows how to appreciate beef. Personally, if you're not exactly a fan of beef (like me), I find it not too special. Or maybe because I was served a cut that was rather fatty. You'll start off with servings of bread with butter (4 breads in a tray), and this is refillable. Next to follow up would be the salad which they would make it on the spot and serve it to you. Do try the seasoned pepper by Lawry's, we find it really great with the salad. Next up you'll have the steal served to you, depending on the type of doneness. The steak comes with mashed potatoes, and a slice of Yorkshire pudding. We tried the seasoned pepper and the steak, and gosh it's great! Would probably say it's worth a try if you fancy steaks.",pos
"Tried the pizza and lasagne. They were alright, but not fantastic. Not too sure how the other dishes on their menu would taste like. Felt like the music was a little too loud as well.

If I do return and try other dishes, I would adjust my review accordingly.",pos

Morton's is a special place for us. First restaurant that we visited during the pandemic to celebrate my bday then. Today we went back to celebrate our anniversary.

"Excruciatingly disappointing dining experience. We had lunch, the steak was touch and hard, the fries served didn‚Äôt seem to be hotly and crisply fried, lettuce was not fresh. Supervisor took no well-intentioned suggestions from customers and insisted the lettuces were fresh even though they have turned stale and yellowish. The tall Indian gentleman appears to enjoy debating with his customers. My first time to this restaurant and definitely the last time. Neither the food quality nor the level of customer service are worthy of the price paid. Avoid at all cost.",neg

"We went to Lawry's to have a birthday dinner. It was on a Monday, yet it's still a full house. Lucky I made a reservation.

First, the free buns were served. Then we had our 4-course menu (spinning salad, foie gras-wanton-chicken appetizer, roast beef, cake, prosecco), a kid's meal (mushroom soup, fish & chips, brownie, apple juice and a plushie), lobster tails and truffle fries. The roast beef were tender (doneness medium) and cut right in front of you. The lobster tails were a bit dry but still pretty good. The foie gras was really good and melt in your mouth kind...

Overall, it was a pleasant dinner. When we entered the restaurant, they greeted and asked if there's a special occasion. I mentioned about the birthday and at the end of the meal, they gave a slice of cake with a candle, sang birthday song and took pictures for us. Service was good. Food was good. The kids were super happy and kept asking when they can go back!",pos

We heard them telling a fellow guest that tea wasn‚Äôt available in the evening only alcohol! Whatttt?!? They have a daily happy hour Monday to Friday but it‚Äôs unavailable on public holidays which makes no sense that you can go the evening before a PH and have a HH drink but not on the day of with work the next day (?!) seems stingy of them, but especially when the restaurant is practically empty!",neg
"Still my favourite Italian spot. Homely atmosphere, high quality ingredients, consistent standards, value for money & down to earth.

The whole restaurant felt so cramped, the wait staff kept squeezing in between our chairs.
Called for the bill at 9.25pm and waited till 9.45pm for them to return my credit card. I would love to visit Lawry‚Äôs again but pls avoid going during occasions like Mother‚Äôs Day or Father‚Äôs Day etc. The time spent waiting is quite ridiculous.",neg

Please add more vegetarian dishes! I really expected the pizza and some other dishes that are at the other PS cafe locations.

"I had been patronising Lawry's Singapore for many years. It always bring me joy, from the moment I stepped into the restaurant, from the service rendered and definitely from the food they served too.

Service - Top notch service. There was once my family was there and my wife had to carry a baby in the arms. The waitress offered to cut up the steak to smaller parts so that my wife can enjoy her steak with one hand. How thoughtful is that!

Ambience - Really feels like a world of its own. Just so cozy and welcoming. We love the place so much we had our wedding photos taken in the restaurant back then. The staff were all so accommodating and still brings a smile to my face whenever I thought of it. :)

Food - The warm bread basket and butter is DELICIOUS! Sometimes I try not to over indulge in it cos saving my stomach space for the main course. But most of the time, I can't help it and finish it up! Next is the spinning bowl salad, served with chilled fork. Love the bits of beetroot, mashed eggs, and their signature sauce. Don't forget to add some Lawry's pepper to have the full flavour unlocked. Steak - Best prime ribs, ever. It just melt in the mouth and if you feel like giving your taste buds a little surprise, add a little horseradish whipped cream to have a small perk you up! And the Yorkshire pudding to pair with the steak sauce is match made in heaven!

Lawry's is one of the places that I had been going for the past 10 over years, and will continue to do so for the many years to come. Cheers to everyone in Lawry's and best wishes. :)",pos

"Ok I really don't get how they're getting all these 5 star reviews praising the food. Did I go on a wrong day, that the chef was just not feeling it???

So party of 6. Ordered 3 steaks, 1 pork rib, 1 chicken, 1 fish. So let's start off with the WORST dish, the chicken. It was so dry it was probably worse than Sahara desert. It was SO tough I had to use a steak knife to cut it. It was so so so so bad, but it cost 82$, so I was just rage-eating at that point, just not wanting to waste my 82$. Consuming every piece of meat down with disgust.

Pork ribs were slightly better in taste, but barely had any flesh. Fish was ok, passable.

And if you're thinking ""It's a rib house, you guys are stupid for not ordering their steak."" Well let me tell you...the steaks were no where better. That's why I don't get all the 5star reviews?! Medium rare was just rare. And well-done was medium rare. And one of the cut we got had sooooo much fats. Probably only half the cut was edible. And the steak was just overall lacking in flavour.

You know what's the best dish of the entire night? The complimentary birthday chocolate cake. Not because it's complimentary, but legit it was the most edible and tasty food item of the night.

All in all, this will be my first and last time dining here.

Oh but side note, their service was good. Room for improvement on attentiveness.",neg
Roast pork entree was excellent and the pasta was good as well.,pos

"Reccomended dish: Ribeye steak.

Nice ambience with good service. The food was okay. We went with steak for the night and the 4 course set meal. Initially it was quite hard to get the attention of the waiters to order our food, they were visibly busy with a full house. I have never heard so many birthday songs in one meal. Almost every table was a birthday celebration and kudos to the staff for singing from one table to another, including ours. The 4 course meal although filling, did not triumph the ribeye mains ala carte.

What made their service stand out from other restaurants is that after the birthday celebration, a staff helped us with taking photo with a camera and our handphones. Then had the photo printed out and slotted into a standee. Nice touch!

For the 4 course set meal, you can opt for spinach or peas. The peas are nice! Unlike the usual restaurants elsewhere. You can also try the salt and pepper spices that they have on your table. Pretty good but a pity they don't sell them anymore.",pos
I think they are short handed.  We had set lunch   Main courses are not fantastic.   Fish and chip has a mud taste.   The wild mushrooms pasta had a bitter taste.,neg

delicious pasta and tiramisu! service was prompt too! very good food!,pos
"For that price, the steak is really underwhelming. We ordered the English cut and Lawry's cut medium rare. There's hardly any seasoning on the meat you just taste gravy most of the time.

The salad is alright, the bread is like airplane bread. Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes are ok.

Service was good though, so I suppose 1 star for the food and an additional one for the service.

Overall though, for my money, I'd choose Morton's or Bistecca instead.",neg

Every waiter/waitress was super busy we had to walk to them so many times just to get what we needed. And they did not serve us the junior meals' ice cream AT ALL. I ordered 2 menus from junior menu for both girls I brought to the restaurant. And we only realised we never were served our ice cream. Felt cheated for not getting something we already paid for. Staff were kind but way too busy and not focused.,neg

"Love the cheese platter. Every table may get different types of cheese so it‚Äôs a surprise (omakase)! Aged steak was very tender, mashed potato and brown sauce were awesome, and Brussels sprouts were nicely roasted and not bitter. I didn‚Äôt like the fried Camembert ice cream - was too pungent for me, both the Camembert and the Hokkaido milk ice cream (also strong taste which reminds me of goat‚Äôs milk).",pos

We asked for a classic pasta, very simple and traditional. However, the garlic used was not fresh. It was difficult to eat. I might give it one more try but I will not buy another bottle of overpriced wine.",neutral
"The promotion was well intended. But the delivery was very poor.

Restaurant claimed that they were overbooked and most of the food sold out.  

Some of the key dishes were outright emptied when we came and started dinner at 7pm.  Too disappointing. What could have been done is to call Customer ahead to inform of the situation, and let the Customer to decide whether to proceed.  After all, diners would have expected to be fed according to what the menu promised.",neg

Extremely great service by staff Rozalino who gave us suggestion to order the cut of the day (r-bone) instead of individual steak as we are sharing.

For a party of 6, I think we were too ambitious and couldn't finish the cold cuts as it's pretty huge and we had our mains as well. The mains we had (pork chop and seafood platter) were probably our least favourite, and I think we would stick to the small bites (not that small actually) next time.

Inconsistent standard for the cook on chicken and cauliflower. Often overcharred which is really carcinogenic for the consumer. no matter how many times we remind them he kitchen just cannot standardise,neg
Food was excellent as was expected. Service crew was not as helpful and pleasant. My guest was not familiar with the menu. Ordered a pasta that she had thought was cheese-free. She asked to make sure there was no cheese topping. But the pasta sauce was cheese-based. The service staff could have been more alert and informed my guest that it was a cheese-based sauce.,pos

"We had dinner here recently as we used to love coming here many years ago and were visiting Singapore. The spinning salad was just ok. It was quickly followed by the prime rib and accompaniments. We had ordered two sides with our meal but were offered a side when they cut our prime rib. The prime rib was ok but definitely not melt in your mouth good. The entire meal felt rushed, and then we waited 45 minutes to get the bill! And when the bill came we were charged for the sides they served with the prime rib even though they had not mentioned it would be an extra charge. This was not the $600 experience we paid for and sadly not the restaurant we remembered from the past.",neg

My hubby like the chicken dish, and I like their pistachio tiramisu.",pos

"Very bad experience. went on christmas day. made reservations and paid deposit prior but still made to wait 20mins on the day itself. There was quite a long queue in front and behind us too, everyone already made bookings. Bought the christmas set which was $229++ per 2 pax. first dish was supposed to be baby squid but they said no more squid so changed to a SINGLE chicken gyoza for us. same price. next dish was ""spinning salad"" which came to us on plates. No usual spinning performance, dunno why, maybe covid. next was goose liver and a single tiger prawn. then a small glass of sorbet. Finally the steak. staff told us wrong info that medium rare was more cooked than medium so we all ordered medium rare. Steak was ok, good but is it worth the price? No way. On top of the small quantity (two very thin pieces of beef...), I could get steak of the same quality taste outside for $30. Afterwards was dessert. Ordered the mango cheesecake but for some reason came some mocha cream dessert. Maybe they ran out of the cheesecake? not sure as no one came to explain. It was nice ngl, but very small size serving too. Overall, very poor experience for the expensive price. regretted deeply and would never eat here again.",neg

Then, another five minutes later, they urged us to settle the bill and leave quickly. I asked them about the service and why they didn‚Äôt make it clear when we ordered desserts.

"Ordered a ribeye and my first impression was that it looked like something from from a cheap casual steak joint (very thin, grey, not at all seared). Upon cutting it, the meat was dark and brown and tasted off. Also had a strange chewy texture and was cold. Spoke to the manager and he told us not to eat it. Probably gone bad due to prolonged or improper storage. He replaced the steak with a fresher one but it was still thin and grey just that this time round the inside was more pink. Still had a strange texture though.

Disappointing considering they are supposed to specialise in beef and they charge $100+ for a steak. You could get an amazing steak elsewhere for that price of even less. Definitely won‚Äôt be coming back.

Service was good, they admitted to the steak being bad and replaced it. They were also kind enough to prepare a fresh salad for us when we asked to take away our half eaten one. Yorkshire pudding and prime rib were good. Maybe just avoid their steak.",neg

The Spinning Bowl Salad was made right in front of us by a staff member literally spinning the salad bowl as she mixed it with the salad dressing. Salad was decent, though I personally would prefer it with less dressing.

Signature Roasted Prime Rib of Beef was cut and assembled into a dish by the Chef in front of us. The beef was tender and paired marvellously with the sauce, whether by itself or wrapped inside a yorkshire pudding.

The dessert was average, and wasnt worth finishing.

"The store opened on 2/14
Only offers Valentine‚Äôs Day set menu
In addition to the steak for the main meal, I am satisfied
I ate the rest and was very dissatisfied.

Bread: Worse than airplane food
Cold shrimp: the sauce is too old and too ordinary
Soup: chicken legs are delicious but the soup is cold
Dessert: I ordered two kinds, both are very sweet, the cake is very dry

It feels like I just cobbled together a package to make money.
Very disappointing dining experience",neutral

Quality of food has fall below expectation especially so when we have eaten better ones in the earlier years of this restaurant.

Beef sausage was awful - hard n chewy. Cmon la guys. Big breakfast as brunch needs to be a bit special n impressive you know, because it‚Äôs always such a joy. Even a McD breakfast wrap is more tasty. What la. Won‚Äôt be back anytime soon.",neg

"Really disappointing experience here today. Hate having to scan a QR code to look at the menu - go out for lunch to chat over the menu, not both of us looking at phones. PLease give us normal menus back!

It was a busy restaurant today but it didn't seem like there were enough staff working - we tried really hard to get someone's attention for some water for a long time, we finally did but it would have been nice if it was noticed we needed water and filled up without the request.

We also sat with empty dishes in front of us until we left the table - easily 20 minutes after we had finished eating. We did discuss getting dessert (no one ever asked us if we would like it - and we probably would have ordered) but couldn't be bothered to try to get someone's attention again.

When we asked for the bill, we were told to scan the QR code again. I just don't call that service! 

Food as always was delicious, no complaints at all there. Felt disappointed, not what I am used to at PS Cafe.",neg

"I recently (tried to) dine at Little Farms Valley Point, and it was a comedy of errors. After a 45-minute wait for our lunch‚Äîduring which we were parched and our toddler was in tears‚Äîwe discovered our order had been misplaced. Bernice, our server, confirmed she had ""placed"" it, only to later admit she hadn‚Äôt! When I finally found the manager, Mr. Aimiel Magdaraog, his apology felt as genuine as a pre-packaged salad. As loyal customers, we expected better than this operational circus. Save your appetite and your time‚ÄîLittle Farms is more about the ‚Äúlittle‚Äù in service than the ‚Äúfarms‚Äù in food!",neg

"The food is great as usual, made even better with the ambience and unique setting of the restaurant. However, the service was poor during this visit. The service staff was very anxious to keep the plates and bowls of our finished food. Once the food was finished, the staff would swarmed in and want to clear it off our table immediately, even though the table was sparsely occupied. In order to do so, the same staff constantly interrupted our conversations. The last straw was when he wants to clear my cup when it was still filled to the brim with tea. I had to tell him to lay off and stop interrupting up. All in all, the food was fantastic, the ambience is great but the service was truly and definitely lacking this time round.",neg

Baked Pork Belly was amazing. Restaurant had a great atmosphere as well. Service could use some improvement.,pos
Loved the friendly service and birthday cake slice... very memorable.,pos
The food here is prepared better than the Gardens outlet. Really enjoyed the scallop umi cream risotto and grilled pork belly.  However the wagyu pork ball pasta was blend and dry. Skip that if you come. Will definitely come again,neutral

great food but place do get very crowded so it's a bit noisy. very friendly staff too who gives excellent service,pos
"How can you get this kind of food after paying close to 300,000 won? The person I went with just laughed. A salad with a sauce that wasn't anything special, and a signature steak that tasted better than the pig's feet you eat in Korea (it's really special) (It tastes like soft pig's trotter without any ingredients), the lobster tail was too salty...I could only eat the potatoes and bread crusts that came with it.
To be honest, the steak alone is not worth the money I paid for it, but the corn and everything else was just so-so, but when I asked if I wanted it, I foolishly told them to give it to me, but then they charged me a ridiculous additional price haha.
The service was good, but the taste was so ridiculously expensive... the worst... it left a very bad memory during my trip.",neg

Really like their stuffed Roman schuacciata with truffle cream. Their baked pork belly is a must try! Crispy skin with succulent meat! Will be back to try other dishes next time. Service great too!,pos

More veg mains options would be nice.,pos

"Any restaurant that charges for bottled plain water instead of providing ice water is a big turn off for our dinning experience. 

Need to park nearby mall unless you are lucky as there are only two or three spaces with the restaurant",neg
Definitely a nice Cafe for a good catch-up with friends!,pos
Food was great just that the timing of the food service  (the mains) was not well coordinated. We were a table of 3 pax. 2 of us got of mains first and we were half through the mains when they finally serve the mains for the remaining guest. It would be nice to be told in advance if any of the dish would need to wait longer.,pos

Their prime rib (I like English cut) and creamed corn is legendary of course. Delighted to find that their seasonal seafood dishes (clams and mussels served with on point baguette thins) were of such incredible taste that we had to have seconds! Their kids' menu is also amongst the best deal in Singapore. Crab cake and lobster tails (order the 2 tails, skinned and buttered to perfection). Oysters a bit inconsistent so you may want to skip. The rib course cut by the table, comes with spinning bowl salad, chilled fork, yorkshire pudding, radishes, gravy. It is highly comforting to find consistency in dishes and presentations. So of course it is an #LDfindsClassic #LilyDawis #LDfinds #LDfindsSG",pos

"I visited Awfully Chocolate cafe with my family at East Coast. I had an ‚Äúawful experience‚Äù and I felt compelled to bring these issues to your attention.

 ‚ÄúAwful service‚Äù - When there is a limited window of ""one and a half hour"" eating time at a cafe, I expected impeccable and swift service to efficiently manage patrons. However, despite multiple reminders, it took nearly half an hour for them to serve something as basic as drinking water and a bread basket. 

‚ÄúAwful food‚Äù - Please don‚Äôt even try their sausages. The pork was overly salty, and the chicken had an unnatural texture reminiscent of plastic. The desserts, which should have been a highlight given the cafe's name, were excessively sweetened, leaving a cloying taste in the mouth. This was undoubtedly the most underwhelming culinary experience I've had in Singapore.

‚ÄúAwful billing‚Äù - There seems to have been a mistake in the billing process, as my 9-year-old child was charged full price instead of the appropriate child rate.",neg
"Rather noisy inside, hard to converse. Perhaps you should do some soundproofing for ceiling and walls. Instead of servers taking orders, we should be able to order via the app. Spent a bit of time trying to catch the server's attention to place orders.",pos

"Overall, the food quality is good, and the portion is decent size. I will give it a 4.5 Star on food, and the service is 5-Star. The service staff are very friendly and helpful, and reminded us on all the promotions. They provide a simple birthday cake and also provide a free photo.",pos

Pizza arrived completely overturned. Salad arrived with no pestodressing and olives (I hate them). Please state that on the menu!! Howcan you send a salad with no dressing and charge $19 for it. Terrible,neg
"This is a pretty gimmicky restaurant, with poor service. The main issue was the waiter opening a bottle of good champagne we brought with us like he had just won a Grand Prix. When he pulled the cork too quickly and it bubbled over, he then told me I must have shaken it. Remarkable lack of customer service. The food prices are ridiculous unless you use the Amex 50% off scheme and there was a very long wait for the salad starter and then between that and the main course. The meat was tender but the Yorkshire pudding and mashed potato were disappointing. Definitely won‚Äôt be going back.",neg
We need not spend time waiting for the table. Pizza and pasta are delicious and they are wide variety of wine selection.,pos
Received beef when I had ordered vegetarian. Unacceptable.,neg
You will never go wrong with Lawry's. Always good!,pos

Excellent food and good value for money. However it's rather cramped as space between tables are quite narrow.,pos
Table too close to one another. Workers shouldn't have their meal at 2:40pm while diners are within the premises having theirs. About 12 workers at one go having their meal. Too unpleasant. Not sure they are here to serve or to have their own meals as well.,pos
Great decor and atmosphere. Good food and service.,pos

It's totally different service, food and ambience I've experience compare to my last visit to Lawry's Singapore

Very loud music. It's not music.
Children are very annoying. Running around and shouting. And the staff didnt even try to remind their parents.

The song played very loud, not music. It's a pop song. Imagine that.

The meat also soft very hard and raw to be consired  as medium well.  Not considered Lawrys quality. Very very disappointed this time.",neg
The food at Gillman barracks seems to be smaller portion n not so well executed as the branch at gardens by the bay. The indoor seats were very limited and cramped and the service was not so attentive. There were 2 service staff standing outdoors chatting whilst the indoor staff were overwhelmed. Quite disappointing dinner especially since we brought my elderly mum there to eat and she didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as the gardens by the bay branch.,neg

Decoration and atmosphere gives the retro vibes, and that‚Äôs not a bad thing. Service staff were all friendly and attentive.

Ordered their famous prime rib, having a ‚ÄúLawry‚Äôs cut‚Äù myself which is 285g of prime rib, along with a side of mashed potato, Yorkshire pudding and the famous spinning bowl salad. Topped up an additional serving of creamed spinach.

The prime rib is definitely worth it, meat was so tender, juicy and flavourful, which is one of the best prime rib I ever had.

Definitely worth visiting this place at least once.",pos

However, Mr Musa caught on immediately and took no stops at showing warm hospitality.

Went to celebrate my daughter birthday.  Got discount for sparkling wine and 1 main off. Prime Rib was tasty and really good. Atlantic lobster dinner set was fantastic. Service was excellent. Will visit again soon.,pos
Portion sizes are very small. We ordered a pizza which was $36 and Ithink it was for a kid. Surely not worth the price and wasn‚Äôt that goodalso. Will not order from here again.,neg
"Best fish and chips in Singapore. The curry sauce, tartar sauce and coleslaw are the best I have ever tasted too! Overall, a fantastic experience. 
Not to mention that the ambience was great for a casual meal out with friends/family!",pos
Thanks to manager for waiving the corkage charge for my birthday celebration. And Ganeish for his great service.,pos

Angelique is also polite and helpful. I sat next to the counter and witnessed her proactively helping a customer. Well done, John and Awfully Chocolate!",neutral
Established international steakhouse in the heart of Orchard Road. Specialises in slow roasted prime rib carved at your table and served with Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes. If grilled steak is preferred they also serve grilled USDA Prime steaks cooked to your liking. Service is very attentive and even the spinning bowl salad is served at table side. This place may seem to be stuck in the past but they are good at what they do!,pos
"Always wonderful. Genuine people, authentic and without the unnecessary fussiness of too many others",pos
Good food,pos
Love to patronise the eatery during my off days to chill!,pos
Amazing food and service,pos
Waited for the food liek 2 hours just for the appetite,neg
Chicken was a bit dry although the recipe was fine. ,pos
Went there for the first time to celebrate my husband's birthday. Had the set lunch and was totally blown away by the prime rib. We ordered medium and the prime rib was so tender and scrumptious. There were extra services like complimentary ‚Ä¶,pos
"It is sometimes easy to forget that there are still places in Singapore that are centered on service. I can't say enough about how accommodating the staff is at Lawry's. It also helps that the food is second to none. Highly recommended for those special occasions, date nights or mid-week treat-yo-self evenings.",pos
Exceptional service by Tracy and Irish. Love their wine pairing choice. Thank you!,pos
Had a wonderful time at Atico Lounge!,pos
Might be a bit noisy on weekends when there are kids around. Food was good but the cherry tomatoes were a little bit strange in the beef cheeks dish,neutral
"Waitress did not have the initiative to give sharing plates after each course. We requested for sharing plates during the main course, but non was given during the dessert. Waitress could be a bit more attentive regarding this.",neg
i wish they have the low carb veg version.,pos
A little warm and desert menu needs an upgrade,neg
"Some service staff tried to do their best, but my appetiser took 35 mins to come and my main course came almost 1hour 10mins after I ordered.  My Mocha took almost 40mins. 

When my fish and chips came, it was almost cold, indicating it took ages from being cooked to served.",neg

Amazing! I will be back,pos
"This is my favorite restaurant in Singapore for italian food, thr quality, price and the service is something the people must try.
From the starters until the dessert and coffee is great, if you want a proof try to go with out reservation.
This is a place with a word must, if you are looking for the best.",pos
Love the truffle cheese bread! Always come back for it. Sides are super yummy but the only main I like is the lasagne. A lovely homely italian restaurant. Yummy!,pos

Very salty . Cooked differently from usual. Not tasty at all,neg

Service staff was good. The head waitress was exceptional. Thank you,pos
Cold mashed potatoes. Salad used to be better ...,pos
"We love this place and have been many times.
Christmas Day lunch is not a fair day to judge a restaurant. They were of course super busy which put staff n kitchen under pressure. It was OK but I don't go such place for OK. Usually the fresh baked rolls are that, not twice come cold. Wines always good but sadly the Carving Trolley never appeared so no chance choose your cut. The completed plates just appeared n again not so hot.
Look forward going again on more normal day n confirm standards have been restored.",pos
"Ordered fish & chips and did not realise that it came with a drink, sothat was a nice surprise! Order was inevitably a bit soggy since it's nottaken dine-in but still good - not made with the typical dory.",pos
No garlic butter provided for the dough balls and pizza undercooked.Sub par.,neg
Great customer service,pos
We really enjoyed ourselves over latte & cakes during our gathering üòäüëç,pos
"Best Italian Restaurant in Singapore so far (believe me, I've been to quite a few)! Stars of the night were the porchetta, burrata and the assorted pizzas (the crust was fantastic!). Service was impeccable although the place was packed to the brim. :) Definitely revisiting and bringing guests there in the near future.",pos
Have always wanted to try Lawry‚Äôs and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Also special thanks to Lisa for making it more memorable,pos
A great relaxed atmosphere with great food steak and chips were excellent followed by a superb cr√®me caramel ! Would recommend,neutral
"The service here was as good as always. Steak was served by Chef Eric, and our table was taken care of by Sue, which made our lunch enjoyable.

Prime rib lunch with California cut (160 g) is the right portion for me, but they offered lunch set with a bit smaller cut but good price too.",pos
"The lamb rack is very disappointing. Although the quantity deservesthe price, the cooking totally failed. I ordered median. It‚Äôs raw insidewhile it‚Äôs burnt outside. Wasted the lamb.",neg
We had a chill time,pos
"Pretty restaurant but lousy service and no attention to details that made this restaurant ratings be way way lower. Food was nice but service is lacking in many aspects. Shown to a stained chair & then given another dirty chair, requested dirty  serviette to be replaced twice was forgotten or ignored.  You can see staff chatting to each other, staff was seated on the floor of the cafe doing some works and staff repairing a table and loud noise   when things dropped onto the floor. All
These happening during restaurant operating hours ! We  actually were in discussion & wanted to leave and change venue just minutes in our sitting. However my sister in law was more patient and just tolerate the ruckus as we really wanted to try the food. Too much to type to complain. We will definitely not visit again.",neg
"Thank you for the pleasant surprise of a cake for our anniversary celebrations!
Only one thing that could be improved upon - to wait for us to finish our appetisers before serving the mains. We felt rushed to finish the last bits of our appetisers because the waiters were holding the mains and standing behind us. It'll be good to take the pacing a little slower so that we can enjoy the food and ambience more.",neutral

Great taste 
Perfect menue fr vegetarians

"Io Osteria is a very popular Italian bistro in Hillview 2. Tables are tiny and placed close together, noise level is high, and waiters make a point of trying to sell you the expensive specials and whole bottles of wine.It is packed with customers every night it is open, so we came early. When we were halfway through our desert we were informed we needed to vacate the table ASAP so that the restaurant could start ""the second seating."" The couple next to us, who had been convinced to get a carafe of wine over individual glasses, were given the same ultimatum and had to guzzle down several glasses. This used to be common in Singapore - waiters would tell you to get out before you had finished your last bite so that the restaurant could make maximum profit, but this is the first time I've experienced it in the 21st century. We'll look elsewhere for our next Italian meal.",neutral
"Food was great, as expected. What surprised me was the quality of wines by the glass they offer. They really go well with the prime rib.
The staff were very warm and welcoming. Many thanks to Mr. Imran and Mr. Lucas who went the extra mile when they knew we were there for a birthday dinner celebration.
Very much recommended!",pos
The staff are all friendly and will check in on you from time to time. We stayed for 4.5 hours as the place is very cosy and conducive to catch up with friends and family.,pos
Amazing experience here. Food was good.,pos
"ambience, service were excellent. food was not bad but a little bit on the salty side. prices are also a little steep, but i could guarantee this was a genuine italian experience because the chef and the service staff were italians.",pos
It was as Excellent as always!! Great service and food!,pos
"The restaurant has very delicious food, friendly staff and cozy ambience !",pos
"The coffee taste very bland, the dish is good and big potion but our seats near exit outdoor, and people and their staff also keep it open never close it back‚Ä¶. I am sensitive to the smoke so due to this reason I will not give good credits of it‚Ä¶",neg
"The first thing that struck me was the number of people inside the restaurant. With the recently relaxed social distancing measures, it almost felt like a hawker center. Of course not, by any means, by the price of the food.

We ordered the staple but also tried the Tagliolini Prawn pasta which was great for the distinct flavours it had.

Pistachio Tiramisu is perhaps the best dessert on the menu and warrants another visit!",pos
"I admire the service recovery by our server/manager. They offered us complimentary 2 glasses of red wine. 
But, Firstly the dinner plates were noticable 
Chipped. I highlighted to the staff. 
Secondly, the food took 45-50mins to arrive. We had to survive on just duck fat fries. 
Luckily me & my friend were catching up so time passed faster. 
Food taste was ok. Pasta was under seasoned. But it was surprisingly the best dish of the night.
Steak was ordered medium rare, but came medium well. Me & my dinner date was underwhelmed. 
Will recommend management to take note of these points & try improve on the minor details. Hope you all can get better as a team. Thanks.",neg
Restaurant seems a little short-handed during my visit.,neutral
The chicken chop and breast are good in taste and have decent amountof sides. The potato balls are interesting and tasty!,pos

"Good food. However they didn't know of my special request for window seats although stated in Quandoo. After telling them a couple of times. I finally got my window seats. Overall, a pleasant experience with good food, ok service",pos
"Truffle fries portion was lesser than other outlets. We were seated before 6 and the server told us we could order happy hour drinks. As a staff was new, she wasnt able to answer qns about order and said her colleague will come. By then, when we asked what was included in the 1 for 1, she said time has passed, although it was 2 mins later and due to no fault of ours. We skipped drinks n went elsewhere after eating. Had to ask for water, side plates even though we ordered a main n truffle fries to share. The staff - not the new girl- also seemed to avoid eye contact when we tried to get attention and we had to go to the nearest one to request for plates. She was just an arms length away and walked off when we tried asking for plates. Disappointing.",neg
Lovely ambience. Friendly service. Classic menu that's the same set menu for the past thirty plus years at all their outlets. Plus new add ons. Usually great standard but my Jim Brady cut was a trifle overdone this time. No worries. Saved the overdone portion and bone and brought home to make a great beef congee the next day.,pos
"I just had a meal with some friends here, and we loved the authentic food and ambience üòÄüòÄ",pos
A nice restaurant to go to for wine and dine,pos
"This is a joint that is opened purely driven from the passion of the owner in serving the best smoked meats possible, coupled with the creative fusion with between texan smoked meats and japanese culinary influences. Dave (the man behind the smokes) was kind enough to show me the bbq pit that was behind the magic of the tender and flavour-ful meats. I have nothing to fault for what we had - the beef brisket, beef cheeks and beef tongue. The bread butter pudding was the perfect end to the meal - the perfect blend of caramalised exterior to the softness of the bread inside, only to discover it was a seasonal dessert :(. Service was personal, attentive and prompt. You have got to make a trip to Kemuri for the taste buds to experience the food that my words will not be able to justifiably describe!",pos
"Had the California cut and Ribeye. Both were super yummy and the texture was perfect! Loved the mashed potatoes (they were so potatoey üòã)

And, the service is excellent too. Very friendly and attentive staff! We had a wonderful time here.",pos
"We ordered the hummus and grilled pita. While it was good, I think it could do with more salt. I also had steak frites as my main, which I wanted medium rare but it arrived on my plate pretty rare. Found it too rare for my taste but the fries were really good.",pos
"We heard alot of review fm the media and finally made a reservation to try.
Indeed the food is delicious and pasta is creamy and savory. 

We‚Äôll visit again for dinner!",pos
"Quality food but terrible service. I sat for 15 minutes without anyone greeting me or asking me if I wanted anything to drink or if I was ready to order. I started waving but waitstaff refused to make eye contact. Eventually, I had to get up, walk over to someone and request to order.  Also, when the food came they just dropped the drink/plate. They don‚Äôt say what they are delivering or check which guest has ordered which item. Although the food was good, I left the place feeling irritated.",neg
"Food inconsistent. ordered a same pasta dish, one was ok. other one was bland. food took quite a long time. service staff repeated my club sandwich order but didn‚Äôt key that in. service staff very polite and prompt, though they did miss my order .",neg
"Pretty decent food, especially the Crispy golden seafood in semolina crumb and Homemade Tagliolini, prawns, lemon, aromatic breadcrumb. Service was friendly too. Pricing a wee bit on the high side but worth the money.",pos

"calamari texture was nice, delicious",pos
"Pizza, pork belly andpasta were good! Grilled seafood was different from what I had 2 weeks ago. Our main complaint was that the  food were served too fast - everything came out together and we were ‚Äòharassed‚Äô into gobbling down  the food quickly in order to eat them whilst still hot/warm. So not such an enjoyable dinner experience this time",pos
Crowded place and glad we made a reservation. Food was ok and nothing to shout about.,pos
"Overall good, just that there was a miscommunication between the staff and manager, we brought a durian cake and asked the staff if it was ok to cut it in the restaurant and she said it was absolutely fine, however after cutting the manager came and told us next time we should pre-empt them before, would say that the manager wasn't showing really good service.",pos
Love the atmosphere and service. Food was hearty and delicious. Although we feel that the roast pork belly goes better if the sauce served in the ravioli dish. Just our opinion. Crispy seafood was delicious and the pizza was excellent. Can't wait to return to try  other recommendations.,pos
iO Italian Osteria serves nice food and is always full,pos
Great appetisers and really value for money! Great for couples or friends and family (:,pos
Great ambience. Will come again,pos
"TERRIBLE. I would give it negative -100 stars if I could but 1 is the minimum.
(1) food is NOT EDIBLE at ALL just taste quite bad
(2) service was so bad had to wave so long for someone to come
(3) look at the plating I could plate better at home, the whole Ambience of the place just felt very rundown and dirty
(4) ridiculous price tag omggg $200+ for one main and two sides for the quality of food I think I stay home better

Come here to visit if you wish to make yourself angry.

One of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore for sure! Great food :),pos
very authentic italian food at very affordable pricing. Seats were a little cramped and restaurant was noisy. The tiramisu was very very good. Will visit again,pos
"Very crowded when we reached, need to queue to take seafood items. The tables and chairs are quite close to one another, making it hard at times to manoeuvre around the tables and watching out to avoid spilling food on others. Can improve on western soup if possible, like provide mushroom or clam chowder instead of tomato soup which seems too plain for a place which charges a premium price for its buffet. Other than that, everything is good. Food is fresh, variety is good. The staff are mostly attentive.",pos
Food is awesome and fantastic,pos

"TL;DR Would come back just for the prime rib and lamb!

Went for dinner with the bf and his mom. Overall we thought the meats were fantastic. Appetizers weren't worth the calories nor price.

Appetizers (skip these): lobster bisque, crab cakes
Mains (amazing!): Lawry's Cut prime rib, lamb rack
2 glasses of wine (generous pours)

With the AMEX Love Dining discount, we paid $275 nett and were pretty full. On a previous occasion I had tried their steak and found it mediocre. Would skip that too.",pos

The Foie Gras was really nice which I highly recommend for anyone who likes it. It's rich and creamy which abit of texture to it.
Additionally, their lobster bisque was really rich, sweet and flavourful.
Also had their English cut and it was really tender, and flavourful. Their cream of corn (not in this photo) is also to try! Really rich and creamy.
Lastly, had their mud pie for dessert! It's a classic and it surprisingly surpresses the beef test after you finish your mains.",pos

"When you have a friend who constantly raves about their steak, you got to put this in your list of steakhouses to visit ü§≠.

Lawry's Cut ($142++)
Each cut comes with a salad, mash potato, and Yorkshire pudding. Lawry's cut is a pretty huge cut (285g) that's shareable with 2, unless you have a really huge appetite.

We opted for medium rare, and the steak, despite the thickness, was surprisingly really tender! ü§§ Each rib roast is aged for at least 21 days and slowly roasted, which is no wonder they're so tender!

The Yorkshire pudding was really interesting, it was crispy, and meant to be paired with the sauce on the steak plate. It's really crispy, and slightly reminds of french toast with its light eggy flavour. It also soaks up the sauce really well, which made it a pretty good combination.

Truffle Fries ($19++)
You first get hit by a scent of truffle, and then yo ugrt to enjoy crunchy fries with strong truffle flavour, whilst enhancing the flavour with their truffle mayo dip!! Defo a full-on truffle experience for those who love truffle, and it's a huge basket for sure.

Almond Roca Latte ($9.90++)
They actually offer decaf coffee, so that's defo good news for someone who can't drink coffee yet like the flavour of coffee ü§≠. This latte had that taste you'd usually get from almond paste, which I'm not a fan of, but it's fortunately pretty light so I could still take this.

NGL the steak's tenderness really got me üòç, and prob one of the best ones I've tried in Singapore, altho the price might be a concern for some.

Total was $201 for 2 pax, but we had 50% off so it's just $100 for 2, making it extremely worth it! Service was also pretty good, making it a great place for occasions!",pos
Food is bussing but so expensive üòî,pos

"Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. Food-wise, it's acceptable; however, the creamed spinach isn't as good as before - there's a severe lack of that delish bacon flavour. That was missing from last night's serving of spinach.",pos
"If you're looking a place for awesome quality steak and best of fine dining service, this is the place to be.

The person that served me, i remember his name is musa. He provides attention to detail and care for my requirements and even explained a top to toe product knowledge, all the way from starter to dessert.

"Had a good experience previously thus decided to bring my family for a birthday celebration today. However, we left feeling disappointed and upset over the food quality and especially the service.

Getting seated- chef was cutting prime rib right beside the table we were brought to, and we were not able to sit in as trolley was too close + hot. The waitress saw but had no intention to arrange a new table. We had to stand there awkwardly waiting for the chef to complete the serving.

Starters/beverage - Other tables were being served refillable water, but we were only given option for mineral or sparkling water and waitress raised her voice when we wanted to clarify more options. There were also some metal foil found in our bottled water/cup.

Food- food did not taste as good as last time. Not sure if impacted due to service experience this time. Creamy spinach, was not creamy at all. Baby pork ribs was abit tough and too sweet.

Billing- The same waitress serving us was impolite and impatient. Was not even willing to help clarify our doubts over the bill/ promo. When leaving, we wanted to leave a feedback at the front desk. However the receptionist said she was not sure of the operation in the restaurant. Thus we just left with a heavy heart.

I‚Äôm not frustrated/angry, but just utterly disappointed and sad with the service price we paid for this birthday ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù",neg
"Ben was welcoming, respectful, menu knowledge, attentive, sharp. he also did the chai latte pour for me. thank you Ben for such wonderful service! i enjoyed myself",neutral

"This restaurant never fails to please me. For meat lovers it's one the of the best in Singapore. Over the years the standard has remained consistently high. I would suggest to go in small groups, and better without kids. Service is good.",pos
"The meat is too much tendons and very hard to chew foe Denver steak.
The premium steak set is better but the outlook appearance is not grilled nicely and burnt, despite it was bloodied internally.
However, the price tag versus the meat quality and cooking skill probably it is not commeasurerate.",neg

Waiters are friendly and skillful in recomendation, hispitality was great as well.",pos
Really good.,pos
Is getting bad. So salty the pizza and the chicken wings still tastefrozen. We'll switched to other pizzas from now on.,neutral

"The beef steak was delicious and easy to cut. Then the gravy was aromatic and went well with the beef. The Yorkshire pudding was one kind - outrageously outstanding! First time I tried it and I fell for it. The mashed spinach with sprinkled bits of bacon was on the spot. I like the traditional way of a chef being introduced to a diner and him preparing a dish (beef steak) in the dinner's presence. Apart from the delicious food, the service was attentive and the decor luxurious. My dining at Lawry's was truly an amazing experience.",pos

"Awful for the price. Meat course was ok just.  Like a mid range restaurant chain (think Aston's/Morganfields) trying to trick you into thinking it's something more.

Apart from poor quality food, budget decor and atmosphere I had to ask for service multiple times, the soup was served barely above room temp  and they cleaned up like it was a hawker centre bringing buckets of plates and cutlery through the restaurant on trolleys. I eat in hawkers happily but I pay hawker price when I do.

Avoid.",neg

Arrived at 530 & staff were warm & friendly. I did not feel like having a big meal for dinner. Wanted to order the kid‚Äôs meal for myself besides the PS burger n a large truffle fries to share but was told it was not possible. Flexibility would hv worked well if more thoughts was put into it rather than a flat NO. It wasn‚Äôt a free meal but paid for so why would you not allow it. It‚Äôs up to the customer to order what they like to eat. Been to other restaurants who were more flexible n allowed to order a smaller portion rather than the full portion n have no food wastage.

Great ambiance with fantastic food and courteous staff. The restaurant is easy to find and the novelty the chef bring on the table blows my mind,pos

Taste of aglio olio not great. Slightly bitter and lack flavour. It used to bebetter.,neg
Food was superb! Service staff are definitely on point! Love the pasta!,pos
"Meat platter was a good introduction! Added on the beef short ribs which fell off the bone. Great food and ambience.. but the differentiating factor came in the form an energetic, warm and genuine Jace! She‚Äôs the real deal and we love her spirit and sense of humor! Of cos she helped in recommending the range of food which was thoroughly enjoyed by the entire family. We‚Äôll be back!",pos

No offence but today I had the most saltiest lobsters in my life so far. Had their lobsters before but today is definitely below average much much more. The service is overall good though. Atmosphere not too great because it‚Äôs hot under the sun when we had lunch.,neg

Not as ordered.,neg
"I made a lunch booking one day in advance, and didn‚Äôt tick the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mind outdoor sitting‚Äù. On the actual day, the staff said your booking is too late and they only have outdoor seat. I think they could do better to have a call or confirmation with me before the booking time. 
Since we have 6 pax and would likely exceed their dining limit, so we accepted the outdoor seats.
The staff was so concentrated on her phone, we had to called her several times, each time we need service. Both my friends and I felt that she looks very unwilling. And she also put back the glasses heavily on table and some water splash on my friend‚Äôs face.
I think the staffs there generally need some training!

We were there from 12pm until about 3pm, it‚Äôs getting hotter in the afternoon obviously. The staffs had never asked us to move indoor even they have
quite a few empty tables indoor! 
Personally, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll visit the place again.",neg

"I booked this place on Chope (snagged a value-for-money 15% off voucher) to surprise my husband and he LOVED it! We had the 1kg ""Cot√™ de b≈ìufs"" which was more than enough for the 2 of us. It came perfectly medium-rare as requested, with a flavourful fresh salad and free flow fries which I couldn't resist finishing. I don't regret topping up for the ratatouille side (like how can you not after that pixar movie?) because it really opened up our appetites to truly appreciate the majestic cut of meat on our table. Definitely coming back again.

Sidenote, french music fills in the air here. It really sets the mood üòç",pos

Stated it was my daughter birthday in my reservation but seems treatment was different.

Friendly staff good food potions little bit small thank you,pos

"No pride taken in preparation of food. Prices charged aside, quality of food is unacceptable. Practically a scam if you ask me.

Bread straight out of airplane service, scallops allergic to any form seasoning, lamb was blue when we ordered medium rare, it felt like I was chewing on a stress ball. You would think any respectable chef would know the difference before serving it.

Had the Lawry‚Äôs Cut and underwhelming cannot even begin to describe its taste and texture.

Service was great though, staff were attentive and friendly.",neg

"Had the set lunch here which consists of a starter, main, coffee/tea. 
The starters we chosed pear salad and mushroom were alright. But the mains Prawn and Crab Meat Aglio Olio were pretty bad. The Prawns were tasteless, Aglio Olio is the taste of Olive Oli and Garlic, but their version looks like a spicy dry chilli crab but does not taste it or Aglio Olio, but a very heavy bonito flavor which is really weird. Both of us did not finish half of our mains. This is defintely more of a dessert place. 

And also the service was extremely unattentive though the cafe was not crowded. First they got our soup order wrong though they offered us a 10% discount when we went to pay. Had to ask for water 3 times before we were given any. Also had to ask them for our tea and coffee about 10mins after the desserts were served..(like once you served the desserts you should send in the drinks as well right, or ask if you would like us to serve the drinks now as well) zero attentiveness.",neg

very bad experience! been there many years ago and was looking forward dining there again but this time doesn't leave my any good experience anymore. was treated badly perhaps me and my sis and kids were poorly dressed and misunderstood that we don't know how to appreciate Italian food? i honestly don't know. leave some honest feedback for the chef but was mistaken that we were like directly expecting some discount or what. judgemental is all i could say about the italian manager.,neg

It clearly doesn't suit me (lol).A waiter in a maid outfit mixes and distributes salads while spinning salad bowls, and cuts up huge chunks of meat and serves them to customers right in front of me. This store has performances that entertain customers, such as the staff singing birthday songs for customers.

One of the best butter rolls out there. Cool spinning salad show but unimpressive taste. Good prime rib and yorkshire pudding but not out of this world la. Terrible chocolate caramel cake  that taste like its from your neighourhood bakery (thought its bad coz of chope but saw that it was on all the regular set menus too)",neutral

"This was my first time visiting Lawry's since it had moved to its current location, and we decided to go for my birthday dinner, which was specified in our reservation. Although the ambience is less grand, the warmth and attentiveness of the service staff hasn't changed a bit. We had a lobster tail (incredible even without the sinfully delicious drawn butter: tender and sweet; we were informed Lawry's doesn't season it before broiling so as to bring out the natural flavour), two set dinners, and one California cut, the latter of which we requested no pink, to which the chef was happy to oblige -- I believe he was quite generous with the serving, as well. The set dinners were good, though the appetiser plate could have been improved: I'd have done without the alfafa sprouts as they overpowered the scallop and the camembert, and the foie gras was lovely, but needed more (or at least larger) crackers to balance out its richness. The vegetable sides were unexpected stars of the meal; the creamed corn was sweet and juicy, the buttered peas were cooked well, and the creamed spinach with bacon was intensely flavourful, though a little too salty for my taste. Of course, the classic prime rib and Yorkshire pudding were done as well as I remember, and the confit of duck was salty (expected, as we were informed by our waiter) but matched with sweet orange sauce. For dessert, the red velvet cake was too mild in flavour, but still moist in texture, overshadowed by the sharp pick-me-up of the yuzu sorbet (nice, albeit a strange combination), while the matcha cake was decently flavoured and soft, and paired well with the azuki paste and vanilla ice cream. Since it was my birthday, we were also presented with a song and photos alongside a slice of mint chocolate mousse cake, which was my favourite dessert of the night. 5 stars for the experience -- I was able to happily relive my childhood nostalgia for birthdays at Lawry's. Thank you for a lovely evening out!",pos
"Table size quite small, not family friendly enough, was squeezes.",pos
overall not bad but the rice not recommended,pos
Food is good as always and on higher price point,pos

A nice restaurant with good food and wine. Reservation is recommended.,pos
"Most foods on menu sold out by 8pm despite having $25 2-course dinner. Even their sauces and desserts. Music was extremely loud, like a club. Took me a long time to get waiter's attention to take orders. Disappointing Friday evening. Wont patronize there again.",neg

It's quiet at the chip bee garden outlet! Good chill out place for quiet talks,pos
Good food. Good atmosphere. Liked it very much. Will come again.,pos
"Food is great, and chocolates are delicious as always. I wouldn‚Äôt want to come back mainly because of how incredibly underprepared they are at every point. Running out of plates and cutleries after one turn is quite weird for a place offering a buffet. The place was packed with people and it was really hard to get someone‚Äôs attention to get an order in. The service staff were all super friendly and helpful, but it doesn‚Äôt justify how long I had to wait. They went up to my table twice to ask if we were almost done with our meal, even though we were just barely done with our main courses(which was delicious). They were super nice about it, but I honestly felt rushed. I feel a place like that isn‚Äôt build for a buffet setting, and I sincerely hope they are able to find a way to run smoothly.",neg
"Repeated customers for years, never fail to satisfy our tastebuds.",pos
Limited menu but food is good. Maybe add 1-2 more pasta dishes,pos
They change the menu vs what I see in chope is slightly different.  Not so vegetarian friendly anymore.,neg

I ordered pepperoni on my pizza and neither pizza had it.,neutral
"The food is pretty decent, had the 200g prime rib of beef, mac & cheese, and Yorkshire pudding.

Given that there are more specialised steak houses nowadays, there's more competition for a good piece of beef (steak vs. roast). Lawry's is probably still the go to place for roast, but those damn ribeye steaks just lure you away, especially given the price points are quite similar.

It's a good place if you want roast, like on Sundays.",pos
Very bad dly so far 2 orders with missing items and no response so farthks but no thks,neg
everthing is good,pos
"We dined here to celebrate a birthday earlier.

The restaurant is known for ots prime rib cuts and live salad making demos.

Excellent service !
Pizza was good !
Craft Dark Beer / Stout was excellent !",neutral
"Decent for what it is - though perhaps on the pricey side - and service is genuinely friendly, BUT the staffer taking our entree orders rejected a request to change the side on my duck right off the bat. No checking with the kitchen, just straight up, ""No, unfortunately, we can't do it."" Later, of course, I find out from someone else that perhaps if the kitchen had been asked, they might have been able to accommodate me. That, coupled with the price point, is a deterrent, to be honest.",neutral
On the whole pretty good; gets a bit too crowded and noisy during a Saturday night though,pos

Rice burger could be more crispy. Ebi was very blonde.,pos
The place is badly run and needs a new general manager. He/she has no idea how to manage a supposed high end lounge. Low quality food and playing music that doesn‚Äôt fit the ambiance really cheapens the space and the view.,neg

You get a free photo as a souvenir to commemorate the occasion as well!",pos
Fries with sauce should be separated,pos
"Gorgeous and quaint bar to chill at on a Monday night. Service was great, staff introduced the menu to us as it was our first time here and the menu concept is really interesting. Quite a bummer to find out that there's no more food served after 9.30pm even though the place closes at 1am. Your kitchen hours should be put up online or informed via the Chope booking to prevent disappointment. Hope to come back again to try the food, cocktails and enjoy the live band.",pos

We have always like to come to enjoy the food and atmosphere in Hardrock!,pos
"Got a craving for prime rib? This place is perfect for that. It‚Äôs a generous slab of tender meat with pockets of delicate fat and a nice salty, slightly charred layer of skin on the outer side of the cut. Sprinkle a bit more seasoning and it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ (sigh). It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to compare this to the more popular chargrilled steaks. So expect a more subtly flavored, meat-quality focused meal. The foie gras was also excellent and very neatly done. I‚Äôm not so sure about the ‚Äúfamous Lawry‚Äôs salad dressing‚Äù which was fair to say the least. The staff were awesome‚Äîhighly attentive and warm. And the venue is cozy and pleasant. Added bonus when we were told we were entitled to a discount if we used a Citi card. Well. That was most welcome indeed.",pos
It's always a pleasure dining at Lawry's. The service provided by the service crew was excellent and they were very attentive throughout. Food is well presented as always and delicious too.,pos
Everything was fantastic! Only gripe is the buffet is only limited to the waitstaff dishing for you; so you don‚Äôt get to touch the food at the display line. Sometimes they might be abit short-handed! Suggest to have more waitstaff during the wkend peak hour buffet period to better manage the service.,pos
Best atmosphere super zen and chill. Food is expensive and small but tasty. Shout out to David for being super helpful. My favourite place ever.,pos
Service is attentive and friendly. Food is good but steak could use a little more seasoning apart from the sauce.,neutral

"Been coming to Lawry‚Äôs for my birthday for several years now, unfortunately the quality has gone down and prices have risen considerably.  The details are what makes this place special so it is sad to see the degradation.

Some improvement points -

No one seems to know the difference between a Martini and a Gin and Tonic at the bar.  When one person ordered a Gin and Tonic it came in a Martini glass with Olives!  We had to tell them that this is definitely not a Gin and Tonic.

The salad seems a bit sadder than before, it wasn‚Äôt crisp at all.  No more fresh ground pepper either.

The good horseradish seems to be gone and we are left with the flavour less stuff.  I think this started around 2020 due to supply chain.

Might have been an off day but my medium was more well done, and rare seemed more like medium rare for another person at my table.  Flavouring seemed off from before.  I did appreciate that they gave me gravy after awhile to moisten up the meat.

Creme br√ªl√©e was terrible.  Cheesecake was served with a very artificial strawberry glaze but not too bad.

On the plus side the Lawry‚Äôs Private Reserve Cab is still ~80 sgd!

I still had a good time but I think I‚Äôll look for a new Prime Rib spot in SG next year.",neutral
Meh experience on Xmas day...bait and switch..not have set menu items @ 6p.. no alternative offered... Did not receive an item on the set menu even though others around us did... Service staff did not correct when pointed out..in fact they avoided us for the remainder of meal...,neg

We were totally surprised with the quality of the dishes & the impeccable service. The only downside is we are unable to stay longer as there is a second sitting at 8pm.

"This is the first time I have reserved a table and dine at Lawrys. From the moment I call to the restaurant for reservation, I am impressed with the service to me. The staff who answered the call patiently answer all of my queries and asked what's the occasion I reserved and dine at Lawrys, I told the staff it will be my birthday that day. She congratulated me and we end the conservation.

At the day I am at Lawrys, a table was allocated to me but too bad we cannot get a table by the window (blind was lowered but I didn't ask why or if the blinds can be lifted). We quickly order our meals and the services is very good. The staff is responsive and polite, evening answering a few of our questions about the food. I find them knowledgeable about their food and services too.

At the end of our meal, we will very touched by Lawrys that they have sang a birthday song and offer me and my family cakes for the occasion, I didn't expect it at all! Then the best part is that the staff took a photo of me and my family (twice using their camera and once with my camera, I don't even need to ask for them to help me take photo.

Overall, the experience was very pleasant and I will surely go back to Lawrys and dine again there. Such great services!",pos

It has a long history in Singapore.
The ambience is top-notch and in a very prime location.
